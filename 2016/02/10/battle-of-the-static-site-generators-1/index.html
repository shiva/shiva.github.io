<p>I set myself a goal to write more this year - in fact, I attempted to do so once every week. This required me to look at my blog, which led to the inevitable: small changes in what it looked like, led to general dis-satisfcation with the current solution I have to publish my blog, which quickly ballooned into a whole host of activities.</p>

<p>Let me step back a bit.</p>

<h2 id="jekyll-is-really-hyde">Jekyll is really Hyde</h2>

<p>I host my blog on github, using a static site generator - Jekyll. It is written in ruby, has some cool features. Overall, it is a decent solution, but I was never satisfied with options it provided. I have hesistated to hack at it, since ruby isn&rsquo;t my language-du-jour, and most of the changes have been quite minimal. It is also extremely slow<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>As any self-respecting programmer is wont to do, instead of writing more posts, and meeting my goal, I delved right into fixing &ldquo;bike-shed&rdquo; &ndash; in this case, research and use a new static-site generator. Why, you ask? To you, non-existent, ever-questioning inquisitive you, I say &ndash; Why not?!</p>

<p>As with any successful hunt, one <em>must</em> make a list: One that shall help determine settle the battle of the generators.</p>

<ul>
<li>Must be <em>fast</em> &ndash; I mean blazing.</li>
<li>Must be in one of the languages I currently hack in: go, nim, c, c++, javascript, python, rust, erlang</li>
<li>Should have good defaults &ndash; shouldn&rsquo;t need plugins to perform basic features: syntax highlighting, responsive images, theming,
 permalinks and good markdown support.</li>
<li>Should have a few good themes</li>
<li>Good community support and/or documents</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-contenders">The contenders</h2>

<p>Scouring the corners of the internet, I narrowed down on two final choices: <a href="https://hexo.io/">Hexo</a> and <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>.</p>

<h2 id="new-shiny-shiny">New shiny, shiny</h2>

<p>They
   - are faster at generating 300+ pages.
   - are opinionated and hence have good defaults.
   - support most of features I am looking for except responsive images.
   - provide extended markdown support by default.
   - hosted by an active community.</p>

<h2 id="hugo-ftw">Hugo FTW!</h2>

<p>Both Hugo and Hexo are pretty good. They are fast enough for my use, and are implemented in modern languages that I am actively learning.</p>

<p>Hugo edged out Hexo: It has a few features that look promising and is a bit more fun to hack. It is written in go and this make it ideal. I am switching to Go as a primary language for my hacking needs. A lot of issues, and about 3000 forks is a good opportunity to contribute to a larg-ish project in go!</p>

<p>The choice is made. Now to move the herd. I have the daunting task of migrating 300+ posts that were originally posted on different blog engines of the past: blogger, wordpress, and octopress and finally jekyll.</p>

<p>In subsequent posts, I will write about a small tool I have built to help with fixing YAML frontmatter after converting posts from html to markdown.</p>
