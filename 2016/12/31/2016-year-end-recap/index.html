    <h2 id="dont-smoke-stay-quit--doing-great">Donâ€™t smoke (Stay quit!!) : Doing great!</h2>
<p>There is no desire to smoke. After being a smoker for over a decade, I was very glad to quit, and stay quit. The way I quit this time was quite cliched. I went to Vegas, smoked incessantly for 3 days, and stopped at the end of the trip &ndash; cold turkey. Never went back to it, and quite frankly disgusted by the thought of smoking now.</p>
<h2 id="say-yes-more-often-did-well">Say yes more often: Did well.</h2>
<p>I have reduced negativity greatly. This is a good one to keep at for the next year.</p>
<h2 id="read-a-book-a-month-failing-miserably">Read a book a month: Failing miserably.</h2>
<p>Multiple incomplete books. Really finished only <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2016/856502">one book this year</a> - The Drunkard&rsquo;s Walk: How Randomness rules our lives.</p>
<p>Other books caught my attention this year:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13072034-sustainable-materials---with-both-eyes-open">Sustainable Materials - With Both Eyes Open</a> by  Julian M. Allwood, Jonathan M. Cullen</li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18736925-capital-in-the-twenty-first-century">Capital in the Twenty-First Century</a>  by  Thomas Piketty</li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8082269-domain-specific-languages">Domain-Specific Languages</a> by Martin Fowler</li>
</ul>
<p>I need to up my game here. The plan is dedicate the first weekend of every month to a book. I need to read more than one book a year!</p>
<h2 id="write-an-app-a-month-passable">Write an app a month: Passable.</h2>
<p>Built a few apps this year. Unlike other years, I managed to finish them enough to launch them into the wild. It was quite satifying to be able to get them of a git repo, and have them running.</p>
<p>I have learnt quite a bit through the process, and perhaps will write more about deploying node js apps in production.</p>
<p>There is potential for a product that simplifies authentication and authorization. All <a href="https://auth0.com/">existing</a> <a href="https://stormpath.com/">solutions</a> that I have tried this year still get in the way of the user. We desperately need a universal interface for identity &ndash; perhaps hardware that can make oAuth more ammenable for login.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://blog.shiv.me/spellcaster/">Spellcaster</a> - find that perfect MTG card.</li>
<li><a href="http://shiv.me/wishlists/">Wishlists</a> - maintain a list of wishlists . Was especially useful for Secret Santa this year</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="blog-once-a-week-failing-miserably">Blog once a week: Failing miserably.</h2>
<p>This is going back on the list for next year. I have consumed a lot of content this year, but produced very little.. Most of my posts have been photos on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/shivanand/">Instagram</a> &ndash; photos of food!</p>
