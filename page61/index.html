      <p>As I have mentioned earlier, I have recently moved to a new team at office.<br />
<br />This weekend, we went on a team outing to Mahabalipuram. Well, if you are in India and happen to visit Tamil Nadu, do not, and I say again, DO NOT forget to make a trip to Sterling Resorts ( and no, I didn't take money from them to say this )</p>
<p>They have this kewl package to offer. They take you on a boat ride, into the sea (3/4) kilometers and, they throw (not literally) you into the water. Actually,it is more like they help you into the water. You get to hold on to your dear life at the end of a rope! It is great fun to swim in the sea, with nothingness for about 70/80 feet below you. It scares the shit out of you, if you don't know how to swim i.e!</p>
<p>We had a real great time... ofcourse there is the usual, TT, volleybal etc, but the boat ride was the icing on the cake..</p>
<p>If you are as lucky as we were, you can hear music from a divine voice.. You can contact me for that... maybe I can cajole Dinesh (ODC's own SPB!) into make a trip with you and sing for you... ;) just kidding !!</p>
<p>Dinesh you've got one helluva voice man!!<br />

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2004/09/had-to-dump-frequency">Had to dump Frequency</a></h1>

    <div id="post">
      <p>Had to dump Frequency! :( No support for titles! Based on the old Blogger 1.0 API and free only for 15 days!!. Desperately in need of another client based interface, after moving to opera. It is such a pain, to browse in one environment and having to open IR just for blogging.</p>
<p>I think I should write a client myself based on the atom API. Now that I have a VC environment with me, I might just do that! If at anyone reads this blog, please do get in touch with me if you are interested in write a small VC++ application that will sit on the taskbar, and will let you post to blogger.</p>
<p>Btw, I found a really kewl photo site<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.photo.net">photo.net</a></p>
<p>A very nice quote on the website -<br />

    <div id="post">
      <p>Frequency - client for weblog postingFound a very neat client for posting a blog item on Blogger and other weblogs available!! This is really neat. It let's blog quite comfortably without disrupting my workflow! Not much time wasted in waiting for UI to get loaded and no timeouts and multiple logins in a day!</p>
<p>Anyway, I hope this gets me bloging more regularly!

    <div id="post">
      <p>and yeah!!! the day has come, when I get to get my hands dirty with some VC++ coding!!</p>
<p>That has been the primary reason for me not blogging for such a long long time. Anyway, after about 15 - 20 days of a good dip in VC++, life is good.</p>
<p>Last week, Priyanka and me, we celebrated our marriage's first anniversary! I drove down to Pondicherry that night (8-sep-2004), on Shankar's bike! The bike is really trashed I say... At the end of the drive my hands were swollen and red. Gosh, I've never felt so much vibration on a bike.</p>
<p>On the way, I got to meet a coupla guys, who were fascinated with my helmet!</p>
<p>Had a great time the last coupla weeks. Hoping the good run continues!</p>
