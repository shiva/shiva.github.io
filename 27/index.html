      <p>WriteToMyBlog.com, is a web-based editor (with a lot of formatting options), that allows you to write to your blog (from another website?!).
First thoughts go like,
&ldquo;wtf?!&rdquo;, &hellip; &ldquo;hmmm.. interesting&rdquo;&hellip; &ldquo;I am a web 2.0 junkie?!

The likes
1. Simplicity of the UI interface - neat, allows lots of space for text
2. Integration of Flickr and Youtube (although I would love to see more such services)
3. Zero account creation overhead.</p>

      <p>I have been away from the internet for most of the last week. There are only a few things that can keep me away from spending hours reading feeds or uploading pictures, and when those things do happen, it is not very pleasant.
Last week I lost yet another wonderful person from my life. I lost my father-in-law, Mr. Ghanshyam Maheswari. He was a good man, a good soul, a great father, and most of all, someone who lived his life - truly lived every moment of it.</p>

      <p>I hate having to upgrade software. I truly do. I release a version every 3 months, and it try to make the upgrade as painless as possible. For an application like wordpress, that has been around for such a long, I would expect that they would do something to make it a little easier to upgrade.
Ok. Sorry about the rant, but here is my problem: the download for wordpress 2.</p>

      <p>A few weeks back, I installed Alex King&rsquo;s Twitter Tools for wordpress. Running it for a few weeks, I found that by lack of posting to my blog, became more apparent that earlier. There are now more &ldquo;twitter&rdquo; posts than the number of posts that I have written myself in the last year or so. How pathetic is that?!
Looks like I have almost lost the need to say something (about anything) and it is about time to shut down this blog.</p>
