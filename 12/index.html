<p>Virgin galactic is a spaceship/commercial aeronautic vehicle that is being designed to let ordinary people like you an me (well ones with $200,000 spare change) to travel to space and conduct &ldquo;scientific&rdquo; experiments (kiss in space? marriage in space? ahem &hellip; in space? **pervert**)</p>

<p>and I wanna get my ass off to space in just that &hellip; 3 days out of the earth! That will mean a lot less coding. Maybe I will come up with the first-ever &ldquo;out of the world&rdquo; open source software, or maybe even a yahoo widget or two!!</p>

<p>Now that&rsquo;s a thought, maybe we should have a coder&rsquo;s meet in orbit! I can apply for &ldquo;work from orbit&rdquo;. You wanna sponsor my trip?!</p>

<p>That is what someone needed to do, build an abstraction layer over the various DVD/DVD-like media so that as a consumer, when I am choosing between Star Wars and Star Tre, I don&rsquo;t need to bother with the media type and the version etc..</p>

<p>Just let me but the disc and get home to watch on the blu-ray drive or at a friends place on HD-DVD drive.</p>

<p>Now, although it is a gross waste of disc space, it is still better that having to own multiple copies due to some corporate hangup!</p>

        <span class="post-date">Tue, Aug 22, 2006</span>
        <p>The much talked about and often cursed part of Java development is Garbage Collection.</p>

<p>I often say, <em>&ldquo;Writing code in Java is easy, but writing good code is extremely hard&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>I have listed a list of links at the end of this article that provides more detailed information.<br />

        <span class="post-date">Thu, Aug 10, 2006</span>
        <p>After what has been ages, I have returned. Not that many are reading this, but I intend to use this for future reference in any case</p>

<p>I have wanted to learn javascript, and this time I found a sustainable way. Learn a language by implementing something very huge in it. I&rsquo;m writing, what I must say a very kewl application at work, and am learning quite a few tricks in javascript.</p>

<p><strong>1. Associative arrays in javascript:</strong><br />
Although, the Array() datatype, looks like a juicy candidate for building associative arrays, that is one of the most harmful things you can do. Particularly if you are using the prototype library. For more information read this <a href="http://www.andrewdupont.net/2006/05/18/javascript-associative-arrays-considered-harmful/">post </a></p>

<p>The solution: use the Object datatype<br />
**2. How to iterate an Object in javascript:<br />
** There are a couple of really kewl ways to iterate objects:<br />
1. for .. in<br />
2. for each .. in</p>

<p>Check out the <a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Guide:Object_Manipulation_Statements">object manipulation guide</a></p>

<p>Will add more as I go along.</p>

<p>Btw, JSON rules - the following links on list libraries that aid in creating JSON based AJAXified applications.<br />
<a href="http://www.json.org/js.html">1. JSON in javascript (client-side stuff)</a><br />
<a href="http://json-lib.sourceforge.net/index.html">2. JSON in Java (server-side stuff)</a></p>

        <p><a href="http://www.allconsuming.net/item/view/1497807">The Alchemy of Desire</a></p>

<p>by Tarun J. Tejpal</p>

<p>This is an amazing amazing book. What prose?! and what a story?! This has rekindled my faith in Indian authors, Finally a book in â€œenglishâ€ by an Indian author, without a thousand transliterated words from Hindi.</p>

<p>It has made me see a few things I had forgotten, made me look and find new things, that I didnâ€&trade;t knew existed.</p>

<p>Thank you Tarun, you need to write more!</p>

<p>by Ron Howard</p>

<p>Well, finally managed to catch the moview! The moview has been banned all over Tamil Nadu (Drat!!!), but I chanced to catch it. IPrehaps because I have read the book, the actors seem to be mere narrators of the script. I could hardly accept Tom Hanks (guess he is getting a little old these days), as Robert Langdon. I like Silas though, but would have expected a more burly man!</p>

<p>Aringarosa, fails to convey the passion that he felt for christianity!! But nevertheless, the movie is a must watch, atleast for you to realise, you are better off reading a book, than watching it!</p>

        <p>One more little thing that is painfully difficult to do in Java. (I love Java though ;) )<br />
There are two ways of getting it done.</p>

<p>a. Cryptic but sweet! bring on the bit manipulators!<br />
<code>
private long getLong(byte[] mbytes) {  
long lValue =0;  
for (int i :  mbytes.length) {  
lValue = (lValue&lt; &lt;8) | (mbytes[i] &amp; 0xff);  
}  
return lValue;  
}  
</code></p>

<p>b. painfully slow and created a gazzillon objects (sooo typically Java)<br />
write byte array to DataOutputStream, and read from corresponding input stream using readLong()</p>

        <p>Check out the news item!! The height of hypocrisy! When there a thousand things we can raise hue and cry over, all we can manage is go on a hunger strike to avoid screening a movie?!! We got to be better than this.. someone please tell me .. we got to be better than this!<br />

        <p>The ability to put together a set of innovations into real-life use and build something that reaches the lives of common men, making it a tad easier, a tad more fun .. that I think is the most amazing ability that a person can have. We were discuss this among many other, at office the other day, when we decided to go to a movie.</p>

<p>Now, I have this habit of watching a movie at &ldquo;Satyam&rdquo; - chennai&rsquo;s very own sofisticated multiplex. Aparently, they have a website through which you can <a href="http://thecinema.in">book tickets</a>. It is one of the few usable flash based sites, that I have seen. What was amazing for me was that, they also have an option for you to choose the snacks that you would like to eat when you are there!! Kewl uhh?!!</p>

<p>Well, all you need to do is book the tickets, choose the grub that you wanna munch on, and use a credit-card. You can collect your tickets at a counter at the movie hall. During interval, your grub will be delivered to your seat!! Now that&rsquo;s what I call personalised Integrated Services!!</p>

        <p>I was always intrigued and amazed by the ability of human beings to give up their lives at some of the most beautifiul places. Why do people like to jump of cliffs that provide a breathtaking view, or bridges like the one at SFO with its capability to produce &ldquo;suddenly-surreal&rdquo; images!</p>

<p>Check out some statistics on the suicides at the SFO gate<br />

        <span class="post-date">Tue, May 9, 2006</span>
        <p>There is an issue with installing the latest version of boast machine v3.1.</p>

<p>The message displayed during install is this<br />
<code>Error message : Invalid default value for 'author'</code></p>

<p>The problem is due to the following code in install.php<br />
<code>author INT(10) NOT NULL default ' ',</code></p>

<p>This should be changed to<br />
<code>author INT(10) NOT NULL ,</code></p>

<p>Some one tell me what the hell are they talking about in this movie!!!! It is the mind-numbing experience of watching 7 movies at one go.</p>

<p>I must give it to the director though, for tying together each of the sub-plots, but man.. you gotta tell me something by the end of the story!!</p>

        <span class="post-date">Fri, Mar 3, 2006</span>
        <p>well, about a coupla months back, I got myself a guitar and having been since then, utting my fingers at it on and off (mostly after midnight).</p>

<p>I have finally learnt how to play a few bars of &ldquo;Ilaya Nila&rdquo;, the song that really pushed me towards learning the guiatr in the first place.</p>

<p>After numerous attempts to find the notes myself and failing quite miserably at that, I found this amazingly true reproduction of the original, <a href="http://www.wholenote.com/default.asp?src=l&amp;l=8646&amp;p=1">Guitar Lesson #8646 at WholeNote: Ilaya Nila</a> by Ananth Narayanan. Kudos to you dude!</p>

<p>I simply love that song. Ohh yeah, btw I just turned my fingeres sore, over that last interlude!</p>
