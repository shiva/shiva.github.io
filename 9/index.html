        <span class="post-date">Mon, Oct 1, 2007</span>
        <p><a href="http://facebook.com"><img src="http://blog.shiv.me/images/2716607_583d962613.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>I wrote this a few months back, when I had just starting using facebook, but never got around to posting it. With a recent cleaning spee (of my laptop) I found it lying in a neat corner. If you are not already infected by facebook, here it is.</p>

<p><a href="http://facebook.com">Facebook</a>, is a web2.0 app that has the most serious drain on productivity, and got me to waste all of 5 hours on it, doing nothing but organizing, linking, inviting hundreds of friends; and just lounging around!</p>

<p>Why? It is not just another application, it is a platform, it is an aggregator of sorts, of not data, but of people. It takes the whole idea of social networking to the next level, and gives people a load of cool things to play with and keeps you and your friends engaged. It can be either as fun or as hip or as geeky or as professional as you want it to be. How? Coz it lets you add the services that you see as best useful for you. So unlike <a href="http://orkut.com">orkut</a> (mostly for the younger ones - a.k.a college kids wanting to just gossip or get in touch or whatever), and very much unlike <a href="http://linkedin.com">linkedin</a> (you just create a network and there is no way except good ol&rsquo; mails or thereabouts to interact with people)</p>

<p>Well, after a serious <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>6</sub> hours with facebook, I really think that is there is one social-networking (somebody find a shorter name for this - how about socNET?!) that I would recommend, it would be facebook. Why ?! Coz, I can promote and show off the following</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://shvelmur.com">My blog</a>/anything with RSS using <a href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=2352898944">feedinvasion</a>.</li>
<li>Music I listen to using <a href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=2413267546">iLike</a>.</li>
<li>Movies that I watch using <a href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=2558160538">flixster</a>.</li>
<li>Articles that I read <a href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=2354684299">Google reader shared items app</a>.</li>
<li>Photos that I have taken using <a href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=2305272732">photos app</a>.</li>
<li>Videos that I have made using <a href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=2392950137">Video app</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>So these are the applications that I use currently, and they change every time I log on to <a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=592106173">facebook</a>.</p>

<p>So you are better served to checking out <a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=592106173">my profile on facebook</a> everyday or rather, your own, since you will get notifications of what I have done recently, as I do it, instead of my <a href="http://shvelmur.com">website</a> (that is you are one of the poor souls, who still have faith in my blogging skills - :&gt;) &lt;- (That was my evil grin). That way you get not only what I write about, but also, a whole host of things about me. May I say: One small step for an online app, but a giant leap for web as a platform!</p>

        <p>I had to compare machine hardware today, and found information on that <a href="http://esofthub.blogspot.com/2006/10/view-processor-speed-and-ram-size.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>**#prtdiag -v - **Gives hardware information about FSB, Sparc Model, CPU speed, RAM, Harddisks, USB drives (ie. PCI and networking slots) etc.</p>

<p>Click on the image below, for a detailed overview of prtdiag&rsquo;s output</p>

<p><strong>#psrinfo -p</strong> - lists number of physical processors .</p>

<p><strong>#psrinfo -p -v</strong> - list number of virtual processors (cores) per physical processor.</p>

<p><strong>#psrinfo -v</strong> - detailed information for each virtual processor.</p>

<p>**#prtconf | grep Memory **- displays total amount of RAM.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Thu, Jul 12, 2007</span>
        <p>I use AVG antivirus, which has never ever caught a virus on my laptop. For long, I have pondered if I really need one, since I have been quite fastidious in  ensuring the media that I download/execute on my laptop. In my eagerness to try out Dreamweaver CS3 and Photoshop CS3, I slipped in the latest chip-India   DVD (July 07) which carries the trialwares, and boom! AVG chucked out its first trojan alert in the last 5 years! That is quite amazing ain&rsquo;t it? I haven&rsquo;t had a virus in half a decade and boom one fine day!!<img src="http://www.zooomr.com/photos/45074@Z01/2679721/" alt="![](/images/2679721_707625f9c0_o.jpg)" /></p>

<p>There goes my dream of working on windows without security software taking 50% of my computing resources. Oh, by the way, can someone from CHIP tell me if I get anything coz I found a trojan in your discs?!</p>

        <span class="post-date">Thu, Jun 28, 2007</span>
        <p>It has just dawned on me that I have more work to do, that when I was employed. So many things to catch up on: emails, <a href="http://orkut.com">orkut</a> messages, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile?viewProfile=&amp;key=7072994">linked-in</a> invites (ohh. <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile?viewProfile=&amp;key=5109233">Kristopher Tate</a> is a contact now! Thanks Kris! :) ).</p>

<p>Talking of linked-in, the pressure from the <a href="http://mashable.com/2006/08/15/facebook-developers-launches-facebook-opening-up/">&lsquo;opening-up&rsquo;</a> of <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">facebook</a> is showing. Linked-in has added several new features and made interaction much easier than it was before. Things are where they should be; A free member can get in touch with someone they know directly. No need for any introductions if you know a person. (you don&rsquo;t need to know their mail id, either). Finally someone at Linked-in realized that they need to accelerate the rate at with the interconnections were formed between people. That&rsquo;s where the money is.</p>

<p>I kinda like the Linked-in system. It is one of the most unobtrusive social-networking sites. It doesn&rsquo;t send me a mail for every single action someone does (by default) and also let&rsquo;s me turn stuff off! I like that in a site.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Wed, Jun 27, 2007</span>
        <p>I recently quit my job at Novell. After more than half a decade of working 5 days a week and several hours a day, I get to spend my time doing only things I want to do. No more tasks that I have to complete, no more deadlines, no more betas to release (atleast for a few more weeks). I get some time to myself before take a deep dive into the job of chucking out code day-in and day-out.</p>

<p>Here are some thing that I thoroughly enjoyed doing in the first week :</p>

<ol>
<li>Started learning RoR.</li>
<li>Check my email and respond!</li>
<li>Read all my feeds the first thing in the morning.</li>
<li>Install all required software on my laptop.</li>
<li><a href="http://beta.zooomr.com/photos/45074@Z01/">Uploaded some pictures</a> on <a href="http://beta.zooomr.com/">zooomr</a>. (yeah they are up and stable now)</li>
</ol>

<p>I have started work on a small project in rails, which I shall announce once I have a working prototype.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Tue, Jun 19, 2007</span>
        <p>It is comical to see how the country, in other words, the ones who rule them ridicule one of the most important posts in India. How can the political parties choose to gain mileage by being so very fragmented in choosing the next president. How can they even propose to elect people who probably have very little to show for themselves as imminent achievers in their respective fields?! For God&rsquo;s sake, you are going to elect a president!</p>

<p>Well, in this fragmented, partisan election for the president, someone has the guts to <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/2130991.cms">root for Kalam</a>, again! This was announced last evening, and by night fall, Shekawat hints at <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Shekhawat_hints_at_withdrawing_from_Prez_race/articleshow/2132325.cms">allegiance to Kalam</a>. I think, by the time I leave office, Kalam would have retained his!</p>

<p><a href="http://shvelmur.com/images/wpress/Whowantstobethepresident_9537/poll.png"><img src="http://blog.shiv.me/images/poll_thumb.png" alt="poll" /></a>I saw an interesting poll, which pitted Kalam, against the other candidates. Check out the results for yourself. when in this country a huge cross-section can agree on something, then why don&rsquo;t the politicians agree with it?! Why can&rsquo;t we put rules, to ensure that every applicant to the post of the President, should have not contested in any elections, what-so-ever. Also, why can&rsquo;t the people choose their president for themselves?! I think, it is about time that we revisited some parts of the constitution and ensure that we can use it to get our politics back into some decent shape.</p>

<p>Well, in the mean time, we need to watch the rigamarole that unfolds before us in the name of electing another president - <strong>Who shall it be?!</strong> That is the big question these days.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Thu, Jun 7, 2007</span>
        <p>Here is a wonderful way to spend about an hour of your time, particularly if you are in anyway associated with software development. Listen to Grady Booch talks about &ldquo;The promise, the limits, the beauty of software&rdquo;. Apart from that he also talks about pimped out laptops, being half dead, and fun stuff like,</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;I looked at a machine from Siemens, and thought, Damn, I know the guys who wrote the software for this machine.&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apparently, they used UML to design that machine, that was used to scan him for his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm">aneurysm</a>. He talks about several such fun stuff and also about a lot of serious stuff about what&rsquo;s wonderful and also scary about software and the process of development.</p>

<p>Also, it is quite nice to see that the father of UML, is in with times (was it like 30 years ago he did that?!), and is in support of agile and iterative development methodologies.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;We have build systems as an industry that are in the interstitial spaces of the world, and I believe that in the coming decade we will reach the point of no return.&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>A few more gems</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;Challenge for us as an industry is, how do we express the excitement, to the people that follow us,as to the beauty and elegance of the things we have done&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>A special mention of Cisco IOS:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;The initial version was apparently about 30000 lines of code and was donated by the developer (employee #4 @ Cisco), and the current version is about 30-50 million lines of code. Some of the early elegance is disappearing and is a very very brittle system.&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>and of Britney Spears</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;Software creates new forms of artistic expression. They allow people like Britney Spears who have no musical talent, to make lots of money&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now who else can talk to you about Cisco IOS and Britney Spears in the same presentation! Also he plays Halo 3! Now go see it!</p>

        <span class="post-date">Fri, Jun 1, 2007</span>
        <p><a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3084/2567730043_da7faab448_m.jpg"><img src="http://blog.shiv.me/images/2707311301_b6f984beba_m.jpg" alt="12052007282" /></a>Rich Skrenta elucidates the <a href="http://www.skrenta.com/2007/05/code_is_our_enemy.html">power of less code</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I ask you, grasshopper, which is better: flexible code or tiny code?<br />
&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; you exclaim, &ldquo;Learned master, it is a trick question: code which is tiny yet flexible is best!&rdquo;<br />
WRONG! Tiny code is always best. Now you must carry water up the hill for the rest of the day.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For sure, he can&rsquo;t think up of good stories. Just Kidding! Every time we, developers, make a change or fix a bug, we decide the fate of that particular code flow. We take a call on how the module or component is going to behave for the rest of the life of that application.</p>

<p>While I agree that writing reams of code for something expressed much more simply, is evil, is it really the amount of code that you put in a file/class/function that influences the manageability of code. I personally am convinced that number of conditional branching clauses (more simply put if..then..else) that you use is evil(er). The lesser if..then clauses you have in your code, the lesser bugs you will produce.</p>

<p>He then, goes on about something that is totally a different beast. Abstraction in the name of flexibility:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When most people learn objective languages, the first thing they do is go ape. I mean, they create superclasses that have one method, which is stubbed out, and twenty children classes, each of which varies by one line of code. They fall so in love with objects that they think everything needs to be its OWN TYPE of object.<br />
Often this is done in the name of flexibility. &ldquo;Look, I have this abstract superclass which currently does the drawing for all my buttons, but you could subclass it to, say, draw 3D text!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is something, that I just couldn&rsquo;t believe is a real problem. Why? Well, I have, in my last 6+ years of development in both, service and product companies, never ever had to stay awake because of too much abstraction.</p>

<p>Most of the time, I find the converse is true. Apparently anyone (who write code for money: (Ohh.. by the way, the word apparently is a very convenient word, it lets me state something, without having to really prove it with some hard facts :) - I learned this from <a href="http://www.douglasadams.com/">Douglas - we miss ye</a>)), seems uninterested in abstracting code, care less for code re-use.</p>

<p>Let us just step back and think, why do most people want to be **this evil! **Human tendency is to achieve a goal, with the least amount of effort possible. (I can bet my head on this: Say we find someway to automate the ability to ingest food, and excrete it, most will gladly adopt it! )</p>

<p>Well, it is always much easier to write a function yourself, to achieve that day&rsquo;s goal to fix X number of bugs or getting a feature Y done and commit the code, than to go hunting for abstractions and re-factor <strong>already tested</strong> code.</p>

<p>Trust me, Rich, I have **never ever **found an unwanted abstraction, or even class hierarchies that run more than a few classes deep. Do I wish, what you were stating is true in the industry? I most truly will be the happiest application programmer, if my library developers actually remembered that they develop libraries, and if my colleagues remembered that someday, they will have to fix bugs in their own code, because of the million functional flows they created and the lack of any code reuse that they have ensured.</p>

<p>However, one thing that I really subscribe to is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t make your code more flexible until after you have a plan for what your app.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would like to add one more clause of wisdom to that:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Re-factor you code, at every single opportunity you get, even if it means that you need to bite your manager&rsquo;s head off!&rdquo;</p>

<p>If you did read upto here, then I must say : boy you need to get a life!! (Sorry, couldn&rsquo;t resist that). Thanks anyway, and if you are still wondering, why I put a kitten&rsquo;s picture up there and what it has to do with developing code - well - Nothing! No really - Nothing at all!! I read somewhere that putting pictures was an important part of writing a blog - something to do with eye-tracking and better design and all the other things that I don&rsquo;t really care about. Ok, I now need to shut up - not another word!</p>

        <span class="post-date">Mon, May 28, 2007</span>
        <p>Over the last couple of years, the onslaught of web 2.0 apps has almost made the desktop irrelevant. With a service offering for almost every kind of application that a normal user would use, the age of installing applications is near its fag-end.</p>

<p>Is this good? Is this the direction we want to head towards? More importantly, does it make real sense for end-users? Ok let&rsquo;s see what you pay for a normal laptop these days.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dell.com/content/products/features.aspx/cto_inspn_e1505?c=us&amp;cs=19&amp;l=en&amp;s=dhs">Dell Inspiron E1505 Notebooks</a></p>

<p>If you get the above mentioned laptop, you pay around $1000 for the OS (Vista), a bunch of useless programs that you will never use, 1 GB of RAM and tons of HDD space. Now, let&rsquo;s see what are the other costs of using online apps. (assuming that you use only open-source/free applications like I do, that would be the cost of using desktop apps)</p>

<ol>
<li>Pay for broadband services</li>
<li>Cost of working online.</li>
</ol>

<p>The second part is something that we never measure. Let us say, you want to write a really lenthy document, say, you are student and want to do your assginment using an online writer (like <a href="http://www.zoho.com/">Zoho</a> or <a href="http://docs.google.com/">Google Docs</a>). How long does it take for you to get your work done vs the time is takes whilst using Open Office ro MS Word. The whole process of getting on the web, signing into your application of choice, clicking on a zillion things, your document loading along with a few MBs (I&rsquo;m exaggerating, a few hundred KBs if not more) worth of javascript, on your browser that leaks memory like a sieve.</p>

<p>Over time, you see that you end up losing quite a bit of time, not to mention energy, waiting for web-apps to load up and for you to get your work done. Well, one thing is easy with web-apps and that is collaboration. You want to share your documents with a couple of friends, or maybe be your class, then it usually takes just a click, and you can share it with the world if you please and get it indexed on a search engine in a shorter time. That has been the key advantage, more than the claimed, ease of use, simplicity and the lack of install. Another thing that is very attractive is versioning capabilities that most tools have today.</p>

<p>Check out this article on <a href="http://webworkerdaily.com/2007/05/23/open-thread-do-rich-internet-applications-matter-to-you/">how much RIA matters to the common man</a></p>

<p>Also, check out this comparison of <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/webified_desktop_apps_vs_browser_apps.php">Webified-Desktop Apps Vs Browser-based Apps</a></p>

<p>Personally, as an end-user, I could care less if I am oblivious to the context of an application, whether online or offline. I need to be able to</p>

<ul>
<li>Get access to my data, whether I am online or not.</li>
<li>Open and work with my data instantaneously (ofcourse, this is currently not available with either online or desktop apps)</li>
<li>Share the content that I have created with my colleagues</li>
<li>Keep a log of changes that will make it easier for me to get my content back in case I screw up</li>
</ul>

<p>When all of that happens, whether on the desktop or from within a browser, I would be one content user, and computers would have done what they were supposed to do in the first place. DO MY WORK FOR ME, so that I can GO BE CREATIVE!</p>

        <span class="post-date">Thu, May 24, 2007</span>
        <p>Finally upgraded to <a href="http://wordpress.org/download/">wordpress 2.2.</a></p>

<p>Geez!! It was released almost a week back and I hadn&rsquo;t upgraded!!! I know, I know! I am a little paranoid!</p>

<p>I wonder why, that every time I update my wordpress version, I need to go through this very laborious task, of backing up my database, the entire wordpress folder, the last underwear that I wore, etc. Scripts guys! I need a script that does all that. Installing wordpress takes 2 steps, but upgrading 5?!</p>

<p>Your concise 5 step upgrade, cost me almost an hour (check and recheck everything)</p>

<p>I understand that you need to change a lot of things in a release, but atleast, you can stop fiddling with the database schema, for every single release?! Or maybe, you don&rsquo;t! I have no way of knowing. Do let me know, if I really require to backup, when you make a release.</p>

<p>If I do, give me a script that I can run, a UI would be nice, that would tar/zip the directories, replace all files that require replacing. You know what? I would really like it if I can run a cron job, that will contact the wordpress website, download the latest patch and upgrade my blog, all when I am doing my laundry (Then I can forget about my blog, and wash my underwear!)</p>

<p>I am willing to write a plugin for this if someone can work with me! Anyone?</p>

<p>(Update: I&rsquo;m moving to (trying out) Technocrati tags. Let&rsquo;s see how these work!)</p>

        <span class="post-date">Tue, Apr 24, 2007</span>
        <p>I&rsquo;ve been on a reading binge lately. With quite a few hours of flying time, and long waits at airport lounges, I got the chance to catch up on my reading. Went through two books this time around, the placid, but mildly interesting <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Namesake-Novel-Jhumpa-Lahiri/dp/0395927218">&ldquo;The Namesake&rdquo; by Jhumpa Lahiri</a> (skip the book and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0433416/">watch the movie</a>.. way better) and the exhilariting final masterpiece, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Salmon-Doubt-Hitchhiking-Galaxy-Last/dp/1400045088">&ldquo;The Salmon of Doubt&rdquo;,</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Salmon_of_Doubt">wikipedia entry here</a>) by the new age, space comic, <a href="http://www.douglasadams.com/">Douglas</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Adams">Adams</a>.</p>

<p>The Salmon, is a collection of various bits of Douglas&rsquo; writing, and it reveals the quirky, and funny guy that he was. I couldn&rsquo;t resist putting this anecdote online (although it might be breaching some copyright - so please don&rsquo;t copy it any further and if someone wants to take this down, just drop me a comment)</p>

<p><strong>How to brew Tea - Douglas Adams</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Go to Marks and Spencer and by a packet of Earl Grey tea.</li>
<li>Go back to where you are staying and boil a kettle of water.</li>
<li>While it is coming to boil, open the sealed packet and sniff.</li>
<li>Careful - you may feel a bit dizzy, but this is in fact perfectly legal.</li>
<li>When the kettle has boiled, pour a little of it into a teapot, swirl it around , and tip it out again.</li>
<li>Put a couple (or three, depending on the size of the pot) of tea bags into the pot. (If I was really trying to lead you into the paths of righteousness, I would tell you to use free leaves rather than bags, but let&rsquo;s take this in easy stages.)</li>
<li>Bring the kettle back upto a boil, and then pour the boiling water as quickly as you can into the pot.</li>
<li>Let it stand for two or three minutes, and then pour it into a cup.</li>
</ol>

<p>He continues, &ldquo;Some will tell you that you shouldn&rsquo;t have milk with Earl Grey, just a slice of lemon. Screw them. I like it with milk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>now, there it is. That&rsquo;s how you make a wonderful pot of tea for yourself. Earl Grey at that - the English Way. And, what do you know, he likes it with milk, just like I do! Now, go make yourself a pot of tea and sip at it!!</p>

Don&rsquo;t get it, read &ldquo;Salmon of Doubt&rdquo;, the last book by Douglas Adams, pg 27), runs Ubuntu, Feisty Fawn on his <a href="http://www.dell.com/content/topics/global.aspx/corp/biographies/en/msd_computers">home PC</a>.

        <span class="post-date">Mon, Apr 16, 2007</span>
        <p>Philipp Lenssen, has an interesting (scary) thought about the day that <a href="http://blog.outer-court.com/archive/2007-04-14-n32.html">google acquired the world (aka internet :) ).</a> The date that he has chosen, 12 May 2017, sent a shiver up my spine. I, definitely, don&rsquo;t want to see the world taken over by the most efficient search engine on my birthday!! :) That would be some scary stuff to wake up too.</p>

<p>Since we are on the subject of acquisitions, <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?q=google+doubleclick&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a">google paid over $3 billion for doubleclick</a>, a company that <a href="http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2007/04/why-theres-no-doubleclick-ad-on.html">google didn&rsquo;t beleive in</a> when it wanted to serve ads in the first place. How ironic! You pay more than what you invested in your company, to acquire something you didn&rsquo;t believe in! I find that a little absurd, and you?</p>

        <span class="post-date">Wed, Apr 11, 2007</span>
        <p>Me and thousands of other people, continue to use wordpress, one of the leading blog management systems (sounds kewl, eh? ;) ), and proof that is it in fact leading is <a href="http://www.plagiarismtoday.com/2007/04/09/why-wordpresscom-is-virtually-spam-free/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Apparently, <a href="http://wordpress.com">Wordpress.com</a>, has the least spam, compared to other free blog-hosting services. The honored list of competitors, include the likes of google, myspace and AOL, each one of them goliaths! <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Mullenweg">Matt Mullenweg</a>, the creator of <a href="http://wordpress.org">Wordpress</a>, associates the success of wordpress.com spam protection to Akismet. This is something that I use now. I used spam-karma before this, which was pretty good, but with Akismet, it is almost zero-management.</p>

<p>Google, with its wonderful, spam filter on gmail, should be able to do much better, but then, comment spam is a very different ball game.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Fri, Apr 6, 2007</span>
        <p>I have a dual-boot PC at home, which boots to OpenSUSE and Windows. After a very tiring 7 hour journey, I came home to a GRUB failure. After searching for help all over the web, I found some help <a href="http://orgs.man.ac.uk/documentation/grub/grub_3.html">here</a>, <a href="http://orgs.man.ac.uk/documentation/grub/grub_12.html#SEC38">here</a>, <a href="http://orgs.man.ac.uk/documentation/grub/grub_4.html#SEC12">here</a>, <a href="http://orgs.man.ac.uk/documentation/grub/grub_13.html#SEC78">here</a>, <a href="http://www.troubleshooters.com/linux/grub/grub.htm">here</a> and <a href="http://www.geocities.com/epark/linux/grub-w2k-HOWTO.html">here</a>. :)</p>

<p>It turns out, that GRUB stage 2 was not being loaded. So here&rsquo;s what I did.</p>

<p>1. set the root partition</p>

<p>2. run GRUB setup on the MBR.</p>

<p>3. load the os using chainloader.</p>

<p>To set a partition as root, it is required to know the device where the root partition resides. This can be found using the following command</p>

<p><code>grub&gt; find /boot/grub/stage1  
grub&gt; root (hd0,0)  
grub&gt; setup (hd0,0)  
grub&gt;chainloader +1</code></p>

<p>This got my system back to normal. I&rsquo;m wondering where I can get some more information about GRUB, I don&rsquo;t understand GRUB much and would like to change that. Links to tutorials anyone?!</p>

<p>Update: Since there is hardly any audience that read my blog, it&rsquo;s only fair that I stop asking questions.. :) So here are some links that I found</p>

        <p>Yipeee!! Just one word - Fantabulous.</p>

<p>The most painless install ever. Well, actually, I haven&rsquo;t yet completely migrated to Ubuntu, but I just might. Today, I downloaded the <a href="http://http://www.ubuntu.com/news/Ubuntu704Beta">latest beta of Ubuntu</a> codenamed&rdquo;Feisty Fawn&rdquo;. The thing that amazed me was that it had to use a restricted driver to get my Wireless working, but it did detected it and also most other hardware on my laptop. Amazing how far linux has come in the last couple of years. No wonder, Ubuntu has captured significant market-share from other linux distros. Now what is required to push wide-scale adoption, is to make a slicker interface. I know there is Gnome and KDE, but we need to rethink requirements. Greedy as I am, I fail to be satisfied by &ldquo;better than windows&rdquo; performance. It would be great if the Ubuntu developer push the envelope further, and develop something that can compete with MAC OSX.</p>

<p>Beagle, Banshee and Mono integration would be great. Also, I sorely miss voip functionality that skype and gtalk provide. What is my alternative? Anyone out there with a good app for voip? A developer edition anyone?!</p>

<p>It is amazing how much a little money and the eye for perfection can achieve. Kudos to Mark shuttleworth and his millions! :). Here are some of the features of the new release:</p>

<ul>
<li>A migration-assistant, which helps you move your data from your &ldquo;old&rdquo; OS into Ubuntu. Read old as Windows; Wink.</li>
<li>New Games: Sudoku and Chess</li>
<li>Disk Analyzer</li>
<li>VMI enabled kernel, for improved performance when running on VMware hypervisors</li>
<li>All new artwork</li>
<li>New Graphical Desktop Effects</li>
</ul>

<p>Update: I just installed Ubuntu on my external USB drive using the QEMU processor emulator. There are several ways to run it off a USB drive.</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a vfat partition on the USB drive and install using the a special boot sequence as detailed <a href="http://www.pendrivelinux.com/2007/01/25/usb-x-ubuntu-610">here</a>.</li>
<li>Install on the USB drive and boot using GRUB - <a href="http://frontier05.blogspot.com/2006/01/installing-ubuntu-to-external-usb.html">A how-to by Doug</a><a href="http://frontier05.blogspot.com/2006/01/installing-ubuntu-to-external-usb.html">Ly</a>.</li>
<li>Run Ubuntu using QEMU. I went with this option, since I can switch between windows and linux without a reboot. Also, installing a small add-on , kQemu, increases the performance to almost that of a native install. There is a wonderful how-to <a href="http://www.pendrivelinux.com/2007/03/13/run-ubuntu-from-windows-via-a-portable-usb-hard-drive/">here</a>.</li>
<li>run Ubuntu on Vmware. <a href="http://homepage.sunrise.ch/mysunrise/ekeller00/ubuntu/2a_UbuntuInWindows_VMware_e.html">Do you want a how-to?</a></li>
</ol>

<p>I need to have access to gtalk and skype for atleast the next few months, so that has prompted me to stick with an emulated version. I hope to move completely to Ubuntu around mid May. So let&rsquo;s see what happens then!</p>

        <p>I ought to resist the temptation of writing posts full of only links to other blogs .. but this one is good</p>

<p><a href="http://www.douglaskarr.com/2007/03/25/selling-news-is-dead/" title="http://www.douglaskarr.com/2007/03/25/selling-news-is-dead/">http://www.douglaskarr.com/2007/03/25/selling-news-is-dead/</a></p>

<p>He talks about how &ldquo;selling news is dead&rdquo;. I thinks he hits the nail on the head with this one. When was the last time, that you read/saw, a news items that was worth buying the newspaper for?</p>

<p>I can hardly remember the time, I needed to pick a newspaper, let alone buy one. Well, I do read a couple of articles once a week, on the papers that lie around in my office reception.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Mar 17, 2007</span>
        <p>Marius Oiaga of <a href="http://www.softpedia.com/">Softpedia</a> News argues that <a href="http://news.softpedia.com/news/Windows-Vista-More-Secure-than-Mac-OS-X-49487.shtml">Windows Vista is more secure than MAC OSX</a>, on the grounds that there are more security patches for MACOSX in a 1 month period. Now, how naive is that?!! Developers at Microsoft are probably just catching their breaths after years of trying to get Windows Vista out of the &ldquo;window&rdquo; (excuse the pun).</p>

<p>Now, why is Mac OSX more secure that Windows. Well, you never need to run as administrator (root, in unix speak) to get all applications to work efficiently. Since it is based on BSD unix (FreeBSD), Mac OSX&rsquo; architecture is definetely much more secure. Also, take into account, the fact, that there are only 6% of users on Mac OSX, and hence proves to be a very unlikely target for security breaches.</p>

<p>I guess the answer to your security woes, go use an absolutely obscure OS. No one will ever trouble you or you can switch to almost any linux platform (Think <a href="http://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.freebsd.org%2F&amp;ei=ucr7ReSADZqksALhi8jsDg&amp;usg=__gClc_OV6MQNpLPeQPoqlxj0nj50=&amp;sig2=RNJPU0swzl7A-WS-wWRzaQ">FreeBSD</a>, <a href="http://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.opensuse.org%2F&amp;ei=tcr7RYS-D6i0sAL3zYXnDg&amp;usg=__86AC-jrJroIybeDdZDNvQU0Ja4I=&amp;sig2=XrYt_ab6348sdmt8dJPqkw">OpenSuse</a> or <a href="http://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ubuntu.com%2F&amp;ei=v8r7RbmsJJWisALssP3lDg&amp;usg=__4QTMs1DXM_6D16Pjwdd35LWEgwg=&amp;sig2=3AQ5XUC8wVNjpZ41UXqzVg">Ubuntu</a>)</p>

<p>After moving to bangalore (it&rsquo;s been 3 months already!!), I never had an opportunity to got visit good friends who have moved here. Last weekend, I managed to find time to meet up with my old pals.</p>

<h5 id="koushik-images-10032007126-thumb24-jpg-0"><strong>Koushik<a href="http://shvelmur.com/images/wpress/Meetingoldfriends_A7BB/1003200712626.jpg"><img src="http://blog.shiv.me/images/10032007126_thumb24.jpg" alt="" /></a></strong></h5>

<p>Introducing, Koushik. a very good friend from Pondicherry. He is currently work as a Project Manager (yup, the youngest there!) at Accenture. This giant of flesh and bone (much like me) is a strict veggie and drinks non-alcoholic wine only (I tried it but &hellip; ugh).</p>

<p>If you want to know anything, I mean anything at all, about western music, especially rock, jazz, instrumental, classical go to this guy! He is a huge encyclopedia of music. Everytime I meet with him, I end up getting introduced to new kinds of music. Off late, he is into John Mclaughlin, Sakthi, Mahavishnu Orchestra.</p>

<p>Thanks Koushik for the great lunch, and also the wonderful music you have introduced to me through all these years. If you want to get in touch with this guy, use the comments section.</p>

<h5 id="dinesh-spb-clone-sivaraj">**Dinesh &lsquo;SPB clone&rsquo; Sivaraj **</h5>

<p>Another good friend, <a href="http://shvelmur.com/images/wpress/Meetingoldfriends_A7BB/1103200713431.jpg"><img src="http://blog.shiv.me/images/11032007134_thumb29.jpg" alt="" /></a>fed me dinner on Sunday. Dinesh is the god of all things in networking (atleast for me :) ). He has completed his CCIE qual, and is currently working at Juniper Advanced TAC. He is also a great singer/composer/arranger/ ohh a lot more! Great skill at mixing music using his Nuendo-enabled, JBL speakered-workstation. He has a stunner kid, Shaan.</p>

<p>I had a great time with you guys this weekend. Thanks for the yummy chicken you fed me! :)</p>

<p>He is a great guy in general (Dinesh, you have to give me more food, if you want more of this kind of praise :D). You can get in touch with this guy too, via the comments section.</p>

<p>P.S: If you are from ODC, please, I say, please, refrain from teasing dinesh (:x&gt; wink, wink)</p>
