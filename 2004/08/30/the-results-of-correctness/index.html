<p>Check that article out. One of the most well-written, thought provoking articles in some time!</p>

<p>Anyway, I drove down to Pondy on my bike on Friday! Night ride with Tanigai and Prem. Peaceful, uneventful ride home. Was feeling very happy about it! Not for long. I met with an accident on Sunday morn, thrashed (well, almost. gonna cost me 2500 and upwards).</p>

<p>I was driving along one of the exits from Pondicherry, towards Villanur(my wife&rsquo;s College is on the way), and there was some ongoing repair work. A carrier auto, stopped for me (he was turning right). I went through to cross him, and there he was, 15 to 17 years of age, an idiotic blank grin that was telling me, oops sorry , I didn&rsquo;t mean to but I&rsquo;m stupid, don&rsquo;t have a license to drive, but have a license to kill you! He was right there, stick his head out from behind the auto ( and his bike too) just a foot in front of me.</p>

<p>Wham!!! The next thing I knew was, I was standing there, blood oozing from my left foot, and one bystander and one policeman defending the stupid kid, just coz he is younger and has a smaller bike! &ldquo;Get a life people&rdquo;, I thought and blew my lid off at the police guy for being such a whimp and at encouraing such bad driving practices on the roads.</p>

<p>well, wonder when, people on the roads be accused for their error in driving, rather than based on the size/cost of their vehicles!</p>
