        <span class="post-date">Mon, Aug 27, 2012</span>
        <p>I&rsquo;ve been using my MBP as the main computer at work for a couple of weeks now. It is not officially &ldquo;supported&rdquo;, and I&rsquo;m left to my own devices to figure out any issues that arise.</p>

<p>Configuring proxies on the mac for all GUI applications is quite simple. However, most of the *nix tools have trouble with it. Macports, which I love to hate, should read it from the environment&rsquo;s $http_proxy and $rsync_proxy, but for some reason doesn&rsquo;t really do so. The simplest fix, is to override system env variables, and use the macport configuration file to provide the proxy. It works like a charm (one of reason to like macports, I suppose)</p>

<p>Edit $HOME/macports/etc/macports/macports.conf, and add the following.<br />
(I prefer installing macports in its own directory .. if it ever gets too big, I can delete the directory, and go back to using standard tools that come with the mac)</p>

        <span class="post-date">Thu, Aug 23, 2012</span>
        <p>For the last few months I&rsquo;ve been annoyed. Two or three times a week, I get a flurry of emails from Facebook and twitter claiming that I reset my password. Sounds like a first-world problem? It is. However, I have 4 emails linked to my Facebook account and one to my twitter account. I get on average 15-20 mails a week, and I dutifully dis-avow each one of them.</p>

<p>Then, <a href="http://www.emptyage.com/post/28679875595/yes-i-was-hacked-hard">this happens</a>. It scares the hell out of me, but I procrastinate. After a good two weeks, and 40 mails later, I&rsquo;ve finally caved, and enabled it. Now, it&rsquo;s practically impossible to hack my account. Password + token to access from any new device, and I can remotely revoke access to any device I lose.</p>

<p>Now, what does it have to do with sashimi, you ask? Well, nothing really! That&rsquo;s just the bait to get you to read this most important thing. Don&rsquo;t be like me, and procrastinate forever. Enable two-factor authentication on both <a href="http://support.google.com/accounts/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=180744">google</a> and <a href="http://m.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=10150172618258920&amp;_rdr">Facebook</a>! You&rsquo;ll be glad you did. Both have very compelling implementations that are easy to configure and use.</p>

<p>Security is like good sushi &ndash; once you&rsquo;ve tasted the good kind, it&rsquo;s hard to go back to just good enough.</p>

<p>Well, here&rsquo;s your reward for reading this far:<br />

        <span class="post-date">Mon, Aug 20, 2012</span>
        <p>I use git &ndash; quite extensively. At work, we have several git repositories, across different organizations. In addition, I also <a href="http://github.com/shiva">hack</a> for pleasure. Interacting with several git servers means that I need to have different roles and identities for them. The solution is to setup up one ssh key for each domain, and use ~/.ssh/config profiles to control them. Based on the host I&rsquo;m connecting to, a different ssh private/public key pair is used &ndash; make life a lot easier!</p>

<p>Thanks to [Karanbir Singh][1], for this:</p>

        <p>BMI, is not the best measure of health, or fitness, but &gt;30 is a definite indicator of lack of care about one&rsquo;s health. After several years of exactly that, I&rsquo;m finally within reasonable limits. My BMI is 24.0; It&rsquo;s official, I&rsquo;m [not obese anymore][0].</p>

<p>In the last 4 years, I have seen my weight go from 230 lbs to 266 lbs, and back to 202 lbs, as of today.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a good day!</p>

        <span class="post-date">Sun, May 20, 2012</span>
        <p>I have been meaning to get into the exciting world of static site-gen. Why, you ask? Well, I will tell you why?! Actually, I&rsquo;m too lazy, and it&rsquo;s late on a Sunday night &ndash; instead, <a href="http://mickgardner.com/">Mick Gardner</a>, can inform you on the <a href="http://mickgardner.com/2011/04/27/An-Introduction-To-Static-Site-Generators.html">virtues of static site-generation</a>.</p>

<p>After an hour of mucking around with several site-generators, I chose <a href="http://stasis.me/">Stasis</a>, which is a good compromise to the blog-oriented <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, and options-insanity that is <a href="http://nanoc.stoneship.org/">nanoc</a>. With my new-found fascination for Ruby, I wanted to stay away from <a href="http://ringce.com/hyde">Hyde</a> (which is Python based &ndash; it&rsquo;s time to try the dark-side, a little)</p>

<p>[HAML][6], is an interesting markup language. Although it cleanups some of the clutter of html, there are still things that are annoying. For example:</p>

<p>HTML:</p>

<p>HAML:</p>

<p>Although, the HTML version has intrusive tags, it is easier on the eyes. It is a relief, not have to code, the end tag for every HTML element. It is much faster to type HAML by hand (especially in vim). In the end, it was a quick, painless process to convert the raw HTML code, to HAML, and generate the same html using stasis.</p>

<p>Life&rsquo;s good. I&rsquo;m still learning a few new tricks. What more can one ask for?</p>

        <p>This saturday, I will be leaving to Sweden for work. It will be an exciting two months! Hopefully, I will have some time to enjoy and experience a new country, and chronicle the (mis)adventures there!</p>

<p>For now, here&rsquo;s some music. This song has followed me around for the last 12 years, and when it is time for me to go away, I hear this song playing somwhere. It&rsquo;s corny, but its nice.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Mon, Jan 16, 2012</span>
        <p>In the wild days of 1996, when I got my hands on a computer (it cost about a year&rsquo;s worth of my Dad&rsquo;s salary, and nothing that I am would have been possible but for that sacrifice he made), I was enamored by the ease of content consumption on a computer.</p>

<p>In one year, I went from knowing nothing about the world, to interacting with hundreds of other people across the world, talking about different things, and experiencing new content every day. Ideas in the form of text, video (granted there wasn&rsquo;t much back then), music. That desire to learn new things, and to &ldquo;consume&rdquo; content has not abated in the last decade and a half.</p>

<p>Last week, I was mentioning to a colleague that I had to &ldquo;download&rdquo; a particular album by a new artist since it was unavailable in the US (both iTunes, and in store), and the conversation moved to the ethics of doing such a thing.</p>

<p>How can one, in the world today, justify &ldquo;pirating&rdquo; a song, when there is so many ways of getting, said product?</p>

<p>In my opinion, the cost of virtual goods (videos, movies, music,  pod-casts, articles) are higher than their perceived value by the consumer.</p>

<p>With these images on the internet, the cost of storage, distribution, and revenue generation is almost zero. Yet an album is still priced around $10-$20. In such an environment, scarcity is pre-dominantly artificial, whether it created by DRM or regional restrictions or pricing schemes, only serve to fuel piracy.</p>

<p>In my case, I would have gladly paid for it on iTunes, but it wasn&rsquo;t available there. It was available on Spotify, but of course, that is not available in Canada (it&rsquo;s only been 3 years since the rest of the world has access to it). So my choice is between being denied access to content I&rsquo;m willing to pay for, or fire up a browser, find the torrent, and download it. Guess which one I chose?</p>

<p>Fred Wilson, says it better than I can ever hope to (seems like he had a similar problem, and found the same solution):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I understand their muscle memory in terms of the scarcity business model. But restricting access to content is a bad business model in the age of a global network that costs practically nothing to distribute on.</p>

<p>via [A VC: Scarcity Is A Shitty Business Model][0].</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We, humans are creative beings, and we will always seek the shortest, fastest, cheapest path to creative content. We can make it illegal, but we can&rsquo;t stop people from reaching out to their fundamental impulses. Perhaps it is time we change the way we have organized how we make money from those impulses.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Wed, Dec 14, 2011</span>
        <p>If you are in a hurry, and need something tasty yet easy to make, this one is for you. The prep time is about 5 minutes, and the cooking time around 10-15 minutes. If you have a small rice cooker &ndash; the kind that plugs into a wall sockets &ndash; you should be able to get the rice done in about the same time.</p>

<p>It is also the perfect curry to cook for smaller portions. If you are like me, and have to cook for 1 person, aka me,  all the time, it is a no-frills and no-freezer required recipe.</p>

<p>1. Fry all the onions until soft (5-6 mins) in high heat<br />
2. add mined garlic, 1 tsp jeera, 1 tsp dania powder, and salt to taste, some tumeric powder (1 tsp for each handful of prawns), and chilli powder to taste (I use very little)<br />
3. add some salt (increases the temp and allows everything to sear nicely)<br />
4. cook for 4 mins or until the prawns are half-cooked<br />
5. add diced tomatoes, and salt to taste (remember to taste the sauce before adding the salt)<br />
6. sear for 1 min and then add <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> cup of water (not too much or you will over cook the prawns), and reduce heat, and simmer until the above consistency is reached.</p>

<p>cook some rice, and you have a decent meal!</p>

        <span class="post-date">Fri, Dec 2, 2011</span>
        <p>It&rsquo;s my mom&rsquo;s birthday today, and as I scoured the recesses of the internets for something nice to say, I came across this most beautiful poem by the author of  &ldquo;<a href="http://joyjunction.blogspot.com/">Joy Junction</a>&rdquo; about his mom. As most of you who know me know, I&rsquo;m not much of a poet, but I am enough of a romantic to steal &ldquo;borrow&rdquo; someone-else work to express what I feel (I know &ndash; lame, right?)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>மழையில் நனைந்துகொண்டே<br />
வீட்டுக்கு வந்தேன்<br />
&lsquo;குடை எடுத்துட்டுப் போக வேண்டியதுதானே!&rsquo;<br />
என்றான் அண்ணன்&rsquo;<br />
எங்கேயாச்சும் ஒதுங்கி நிக்கவேண்டியதுதானே&rsquo;<br />
என்றாள் அக்கா<br />
&lsquo;சளி பிடிச்சுக்கிட்டு செலவு வைக்கப்போற பாரு&rsquo;<br />
என்றார் அப்பா<br />
தன் முந்தானையால்<br />
என் தலையை துவட்டிக்கொண்டே<br />
திட்டினாள் அம்மா<br />
என்னையல்ல; மழையை!<br />
[source: Joy Junction][1]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My translation, in the hope that it redeems the &ldquo;theft&rdquo;:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I came home drenched in the rain<br />
&lsquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you take the umbrella&rsquo;<br />
said my brother<br />
&lsquo;You could have waited somewhere until there was a respite in the rain&rsquo;<br />
said my sister<br />
&lsquo;you are going to catch a cold and cost us money&rsquo;<br />
said my father<br />
With the tip of her sari,<br />
as she dried off my head,<br />
my mom was cross<br />
not with me;<br />
but with the rain.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. We tamilians are melodramatic and sentimental sometimes &hellip; (well actually, all the time. Some of us, just learn to hide it better) Mom. Dad. Grandma, Shankar and Swetha. There are days where I really miss you guys. Today was one such day.</p>

        <p>Forget perfect pitch. I&rsquo;m so thankful that I can experience a large range of frequencies, and that I have enough hearing ability to distinguish timbre, and tone. Watch the video below, especially at 7:00 minutes. We all must be thankful that we can hear as well as we do. I can&rsquo;t imagine what life would be like without the ability to sense the warmth of a viola rising up in the Brandenburg concertos (BWV 1046) movement 1, or the horns in the 3rd movement of the same.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Thu, Dec 1, 2011</span>
        <p>When in doubt, take a poet&rsquo;s thought to your heart. They are, invariably experienced beings, that have spent a great deal of their lives, exploring the heart through the mind.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Strong Mercy by Rabindranath Tagore</strong></p>

<p>My desires are many and my cry is pitiful,<br />
but ever didst thou save me by hard refusals;<br />
and this strong mercy has been wrought into my life through and through.</p>

<p>Day by day thou art making me worthy of the simple,<br />
great gifts that thou gavest to me unasked&mdash;this sky and the light, this body and the<br />
life and the mind&mdash;saving me from perils of overmuch desire.</p>

<p>There are times when I languidly linger<br />
and times when I awaken and hurry in search of my goal;<br />
but cruelly thou hidest thyself from before me.</p>

<p>Day by day thou art making me worthy of thy full acceptance by<br />
refusing me ever and anon, saving me from perils of weak, uncertain desire.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This poem, expresses a lot of what&rsquo;s on my mind, at this ungodly hour (its 3:39 am), except for the last couple of lines. I didn&rsquo;t want to editorialize a poem, and hence left it in place.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s that time of the year, in Vancouver, when it starts to rain and is expected to do so, incessantly, for the next 6 months (I exaggerate, a little).</p>

<p>It is better to be prepared for it, and enjoy it while it lasts (like so many other things in life &ndash; even the moments, that are not exactly the way one wants them to be)</p>

<p>So here are a few pictures, that show how beautiful and mesmerizing rain can be.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Wed, Nov 9, 2011</span>
        <p>1. Assuming an <a href="http://wiki.answers.com/Q/How_much_does_an_average_car_weigh">average car weighs around 4000 pounds</a></p>

<p>2. Force required to move such a car (neglecting friction):</p>

<p><code>F = ma</code></p>

<p>As per the above,<br />
<code>
m = 4000 /2.2 kg [approx. 1800 kg]  
a = 1 m/sec^2</code></p>

<p>=&gt; F = 1800 N</p>

<p>3. Since it would be next to impossible to get a rare earth magnet that produced that kind of force, we would be, better served trying to use a solenoid. The formula to get the force generated by a <a href="http://www.daycounter.com/Calculators/Magnets/Solenoid-Force-Calculator.phtml">solenoid is given by</a>:</p>

<p>F = ((N * I) ^ 2 * k * A) / 2 * g ^ 2</p>

<p>Where,</p>

<p>N - No of turns</p>

<p>I - Current in Amps</p>

<p>k = 4 * pi * 10 ^ -7 (constant)</p>

<p>A - Cross-section of the solenoid</p>

<p>g - distance between solenoid and the metal that needs to be attracted</p>

<p>From the above, assuming a cross section of 0.5 sq m (A), current of 10 A (I), and a distance of 1 m from the solenoid (g), the number of turns required to produce 1 m/sec^2 acceleration on a 1800 Kg car is,</p>

<p>N ~= 7.568 * 10 ^ 3 ~= 7000 turns</p>

<p>Now, Density of Copper is <strong>8.92 gm/cm3. We can guesstimate the weight by guessing the length of such a solenoid.</strong></p>

        <p>Sometimes working with an old c compiler brings up painful, yet fun-filled days of making it speak the same language as you, and sometimes you just go &ldquo;*$&amp;%*$#&amp;% you piece of sh** compiler&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had one such moment today, and after I had returned to Zen (some soul-searching and some google searching), I realized it quite simple.</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">$ gmake  
...  
...  
some_file.h:42: badly punctuated parameter list in \`#define'  
some_file.h:64: badly punctuated parameter list in \`#define'

<p>This was caused by the following:</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">...  
...  
#define LOG(...) { printf (##__VA_ARGS__); }  
...  
...  
</code></pre>

<p>This works in most modern C compilers. However, if you happen to use one from the 80s (I exaggerate a little - not by much), it throws the error as above. You can fix this as follows:</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">...

#define LOG(ARGS...) { printf (##ARGS); }

        <p>Last weekend, I went to my first photo-walk in Vancouver. This one is a yearly affair, organized by Scott Kelby. It&rsquo;s called the <a href="http://worldwidephotowalk.com/">Worldwide Photowalk</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23WWPW">#WWPW</a>), and it was quite exciting. This was the fourth such event (and my first). I met a lot of very interesting people of varied backgrounds. Can&rsquo;t wait for the next one.</p>

<p>Flickr groups for the photo-walk are:<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/wwpw2011-gastown/">Gastown</a><br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/wwpw4/">Scott Kelby&rsquo;s WWPW4</a></p>

<p>Thanks to Scott Kelby for starting such a wonderful thing, and letting it grow. This was as exciting as [last year&rsquo;s Barcamp][4]</p>

        <p>And sometimes, they barely hold your attention. However, the recent acquisition is the former. I got the mammoth of a book, over the weekend; it weighs a ton and I&rsquo;ll be sleeping with it, clutched tight in my hands.</p>

<p>If you already have the tomb by tanenbaum of similar name, the unix programming interface, you probably are not going to glean much value from this one (you can thank POSIX for maintaining a modicum of consistency over the years and some would vehemently contest that). That said, if you write code for *nix systems, it definitely deserves the shelf-space as much as any other programming book.</p>

<p>In the few hours I&rsquo;ve spent with it, I&rsquo;ve already learnt and have had a few concepts made clear. It is definitely not a linear read and there is quite a lot of interesting things to read about. I&rsquo;m currently working through some fun tests of my understanding of pthreads. Watch for those [here][0].</p>
