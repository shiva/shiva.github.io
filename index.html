    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2016/01/jan-goal-update">A month flies by</a></h1>

    <div id="post">
      <p>It has not been a great start. It, however, has been a busy one.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Don’t smoke (Stay quit!!) : Going strong!
Going strong! The urge to smoke still surfaces on occasion. I have, however, been able to avoid every time. I must admit that it gets easier, but it always take a bit of an effort.m</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Say yes more often: Doing ok. 
I have caught myself a couple of times. Still needs work</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Read a book a month: Failing miserably.
Read about 5 pages. Currently reading <a href="http://amzn.to/1PI7fTC">Norwegian Wood</a> by Haruki Murakami. It is a very interesting book, but I have not been able to find time consistently. TV, netflix and youtube, usurps time away from other pursuits.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Write an app a month: Doing ok.
I have managed to write a small app to collect links and text and store those into a database. The app is written in go and is called notedown. It’s a lot of fun to hack something together. I am struggling with user authentication and authorization. <a href="https://auth0.com/">auth0</a> is a great service to get started with implementing a good system for any app. At the moment, I have managed to put together a very rough version that kinda works.</p>

    <p>At the moment, the goal is to get parity with apps like instapaper or evernote. The eventual goal, is to make notedown provide automatic tagging and aggregation of links. For the next month, I will focus on getting this solution deployed with a simple gui that is cross-platform.</p>

    <p>If you are interested in the idea, you can reach me on <a href="http://twitter.com/shiva">twitter</a>, or <a href="https://gitter.im/shiva/notedown?utm_source=badge&amp;utm_medium=badge&amp;utm_campaign=pr-badge">Gitter</a> or hack at it on <a href="https://github.com/shiva/notedown">github</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Blog once a week: Failing miserably.
As this post illustrates, I have procrastinated all month long. I guess two posts a month is still better than none.</p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2016/01/resolutions">Goals for 2016</a></h1>

    <div id="post">
      <p>The word “resolutions”, feels forced. It feels like a ritual declaration of intent, followed immediately by inaction, and eventually concession that it was all in jest. This year, I am going to have some goals.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Don’t smoke (Stay quit!!)</li>
  <li>Say yes more often</li>
  <li>Read a book a month</li>
  <li>Write an app a month</li>
  <li>Blog once a week</li>
</ul>

<p>Goals, feels more friendly, reachable, inviting almost.</p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2014/09/thoughts-on-ello">Thoughts on ello</a></h1>

    <div id="post">
      <p>In the tradition of joining new social tools on the interwebs, here some thoughts on my experience.</p>

<p>The usual steps are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The first few hours – mostly spent exploring the interface, the features, mired in the comparisons between the “old” and the “new”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At some point, the lack of interaction and content of previous networks – the constant buzz of twitter, the inane conversations of facebook etc. – forces me tp  hunt for connections. Rampant, indiscriminate “friending” of people ensues.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Invite a few select people, find the “old” connections from elsewhere, and waddle in the familiarity of all.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Crickets .. not a thing is said. I realize I have nothing to say most days.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Start contributing content, and attempt to find the niche for this medium</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All my kindergarden, high school and college buddies arrive, and make their presence felt</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Get lazy and stop contributing - the content feed become a wasteland.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>I’m just about done with 3 on ello. It’s is going to a fun experience! Of that, I am sure. Some things I like on Ello, that I hope will break the pattern of “use-discard”:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Keyboard shortcuts!!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Friends/Noise. This is a great middle ground between the insanity that is Circles on Google+, the unmaintainable mess that is twitter lists, and the unknowable grouping in FB.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Multiple layout options. Makes the incessant updates manageable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Markdown. Can’t thank the developers of Ello, enough for this!!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ability to cross-post content between my blog and Ello. Thanks largely, to markdown.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Some posts from others more articulate than me:</p>

<p>@thomashawk quips on <a href="https://ello.co/thomashawk/post/yTBdvFtgsjFuv6gi3kWy-A">his thoughts on Ello</a>. A great read. As always, TH has great content, and also copious amounts of patience in letting such tools grow, and helping it in the process (I’ve seen him do this for flickr, google+ and zooomr).</p>

<p>@budnitz One of the founders of Ello <a href="https://ello.co/budnitz/post/WDPYMs2EvyUqUtDh5lAOiA">makes great points</a> on starting up something new. Nice to see the passion and the vision. Kudos!</p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2014/07/my-eiffel-tower">My Eiffel Tower</a></h1>

    <div id="post">
      <p>Today’s <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2014/07/lessons-from-the-eiffel-tower.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+typepad%2Fsethsmainblog+%28Seth%27s+Blog%29">post by Seth Godin</a>, struck a cord. I am fortunate enough to get an opportunity to build “my Eiffel Tower”. I’m building two DSLs and associated infrastructure to allow storing lots of data in an in-memory database running in an embedded system. Wish me luck! Very excited, I might add!</p>

    <div id="post">
      <p>I hate passwords. Seems like several smart people are on the case of getting rid of the “password”</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lucas Gonze, argues the <a href="https://medium.com/@lucas_gonze/authentication-cargo-cults-ae98d8e359">loss of meaning</a> around design of user authentication mechanisms.</li>
  <li>A world without passwords! How will we identify each other? <a href="https://medium.com/@ninjudd/passwords-are-obsolete-9ed56d483eb">Exchange tokens</a>. <a href="https://blog.cotap.com/forget-passwords-passwordless-authentication/">Make “forgot password” the default</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="https://medium.com/@gwestr/trust-without-passwords-c91146a96cef">Passwords are the new pay-wall</a>.</li>
  <li>A non-violent protest against the cruel overlord — the “password”. Justin Balthrop, <a href="https://medium.com/@ninjudd/lets-boycott-passwords-680d97eddb01">calls for a boycott</a> .</li>

  <li>Eran Hammer — OAuth founder — <a href="http://hueniverse.com/2012/07/26/oauth-2-0-and-the-road-to-hell/">gave up on OAuth 2.0</a>. (An old link). Tim Bray <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2012/07/28/Oauth2-dead">didn’t take kindly</a> to that post. Ahh IETF! You can grind the smartest minds to pulp. :)</li>
