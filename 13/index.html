        <span class="post-date">Thu, Dec 15, 2005</span>
        <p>I have been wondering for sometime now, how K2, added an entry in pages, but the content was controlled from the one of the php files in the theme directory.</p>

<p>It turns out that is is very simple (yet elegant &hellip; hat&rsquo;s off to wordpress guys). I used this to integrate FAlbum into K2.</p>

<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s get on with the tutorial:<br />
*WARNING*: Take a backup of your database before you proceed with the following</p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong> : Open the wordpress database in phpMyAdmin<br />
<strong>Step 2</strong> : Add an entry in the &ldquo;wp_posts&rdquo; table, ensuring that the &ldquo;guid_id&rdquo; field is empty.</p>

<p>INSERT INTO `wp_posts` VALUES (<br />
123,<br />
1,<br />
&lsquo;2005-11-16 15:27:21&rsquo;,<br />
&lsquo;2005-11-16 10:27:21&rsquo;,<br />
&lsquo;Do not edit this page&rsquo;,<br />
&lsquo;Photos&rsquo;,<br />
0,<br />
&rdquo;,<br />
&lsquo;static&rsquo;,<br />
&lsquo;open&rsquo;,<br />
&lsquo;open&rsquo;,<br />
&rdquo;,<br />
&lsquo;photos&rsquo;,<br />
&rdquo;,<br />
&rdquo;,<br />
&lsquo;2005-12-15 02:29:33&rsquo;,<br />
&lsquo;2005-12-14 21:29:33&rsquo;,<br />
&rdquo;,<br />
0,<br />
&rdquo;,<br />
0);</p>

<p><strong>Step 3</strong> : Now create a php template file in your theme&rsquo;s directory.</p>

<p>This is easily acheived by adding the following at the begining of the new php file</p>

<p>&lt; ?php /*<br />
Template Name: Archives (Do Not Use Manually)<br />
*/ ?&gt;</p>

<p><strong>Step 4</strong> : Add code to display whatever content when the page link is clicked.<br />
<strong>Step 5</strong> : Go to Manage&gt;Pages, and edit the page entry for the newly added page.<br />
<strong>Step 6</strong> : Change the page template to the newly created template.</p>

<p><strong>Thing to note:</strong><br />
Ensure that the entry for the page link in the database does not have the &ldquo;guid&rdquo; field filled. This would cause the page to load the content of the page entry in the final output.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Wed, Dec 14, 2005</span>
        <p>I wanted to get the pod nano initially, but I chose to get the Creative Zen Micro instead for reasons listed below:</p>

<p>Why the Nano is a piece of junk<br />
1. Cracked screens &ndash; heard quite a few reports of that and since I live in India and the Nano cost about 2 as much as it is in the US, I didn&rsquo;t want to risk it</p>

<p>2. Flimsy &ndash; the entire player bends with little pressure applied, a little more I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;d end up with two pieces! (Definitely not suited for 40deg C and extremely dusty conditions that I have to go through everyday to work and back)</p>

<p>3. Battery replacement costs half as much as the player</p>

<p>4. about 25% more cost than the zen micro which has about 20% more space</p>

        <span class="post-date">Fri, Dec 9, 2005</span>
        <p>PHP is an incredibly easy to use scripting language and yesterday I had my first meeting with it.</p>

<p>Yeah, I know I support and fix some issues in wordpress, but that just requires programming knowledge, and not exactly great php exposure. But yesterday, I wrote a small tool to track some timesheet info, in php and the whole thing took about 1.5 hours to complete. Slick UI, storing and retreiving from DB et al!</p>

<p>Simply amazed by the depth and breadth of support for other resources like databases, network protocols etc by the default implementation of php! Truly a programmer&rsquo;s paradise has to have a webserver running with php support!</p>

        <span class="post-date">Thu, Dec 1, 2005</span>
        <p>I have been wanting to integrate photos that I take into my Wordpress blog for over 6 months now!<br />
I finally found the best suited solution for me. Well almost! Probably the second best thing</p>

<p>I can now do the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Insert images from my flickr stream into my blog.</li>
<li>Present a gallery of images based on my sets</li>

        <span class="post-date">Wed, Nov 30, 2005</span>
        <p>I found a very interesting bug report on ubuntu! If you haven&rsquo;t heard about Ubuntu, then this bug report is definetely a must read. Check it out!
&gt;
&gt; Microsoft has a majority market share in the new desktop PC marketplace. This is a bug, which Ubuntu is designed to fix.</p>

<p><em><a href="https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+bug/1">Bug #1 in Ubuntu - Microsoft has a majority market share</a></em></p>

<p>I tried to see how the latest release of Ubuntu has addressed this particular bug, and I see that it is still pending. Although, the open-source OS guys are striving a lot for features, but somehow everyone has forgotten the root-cause that made unix so popular.</p>

<p>Both System V and BSD version allowed the user to quick execute a set of jobs, allowed users to stitch small applications to make bigger equivalents of them. I see that no one is trying to challenge the notion of UI that Windows introduced back in the last century! A lot of that is happening on the web, but we need that kind of radical rethinking of UI, if you want to kick Microsoft&rsquo;s share down!</p>

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Nov 26, 2005</span>
        <p>Yet another wondeful ride on my bike, and I&rsquo;m road wiser !!</p>

<p>I rode to Pondy last Friday, (the usual weekend get-away). Having been long since my bike stretched its engines, this ride was a nice change for both me and my bike.</p>

<p>Pitck black, it was, that night, but very little traffic on the roads. A cool breeze was working its way up my spine. Frequent drops of impending rain, threatened to drench me, my soul and my bike, as we streamed past Mahabalipuram. Stopped momentarily at Kalapakkam for a tea. The warm tea, quenching my raving hunger, the news that india lost miserably (yet again!) to South Africa, set my my pulse raving to get to Pondy to catch the highlights of India-trashing! (just wanted to see how badly our team can perform)</p>

<p>the rest of the journey, was fairly eventless (for a change!) and the ECR seemed deserted. Passed hardly a dozen vehicles on my way home! That is weird for a Friday night you know! The ride lasted 2 hours and 30 mins. (btw I managed to miss the highlights, thanks to some movie on Sony - never seem to be able to win an argument over the possesion of the remote :) Pinky wins round 1)</p>

        <span class="post-date">Fri, Nov 4, 2005</span>
        <p>Atlast!!! Finally!! I got to lay my hands on the Creative Zen Micro I have been drooling over all these days! One of Guru&rsquo;s friend&rsquo;s finally agreed to get it here.</p>

<p>It is much smaller that I thought it would be, but it is one of the coolest gadgets I have laid my hands on. None of the images on the web do any justice to the drool value of this pod-killer. The only disappointment until now, has been the need to shell out $40 for the charger, which I haven&rsquo;t bought as of now. Need to find out how much they would fleece me for it in India.</p>

<p>Along with the zen, came the really kewl Sennheiser. All I can say is that, it is german audio engineering at its very best. The audio fidelity of these headphones are simply amazing.</p>

<p>Check out these links for more information on the above mentioned kewl gadgets:<br />

        <p>Wowie!!! Yippeee!!! Yikes!!!<br />
That&rsquo;s the sequence of emotional states that I have transitioned through over the last couple of days. Getting some rains after a long period of drought was nice, but then like most things in Chennai, it turns out a teeny weeny bit much, when I have to waddle through knee deep slush!</p>

<p>Torrentials rains have gripped Chennai, for the last couple of days and today life came to a stand-still! Water logging everywhere, no power, nowhere to go to eat! More has been predicted for the weekend! Let&rsquo;s hope chennai is not submerged by the time I get back from Diwali holidays</p>

<p>Like my new found pals in TAC put it, &ldquo;This is a city of extremes!!&rdquo;. He was telling me today, about the food you can get in chennai, it is either way to spicy, or no spice at all, the deserts are way to sweet to have a second bite, or absolutely zero sweetness?!</p>

<p>Yup mate, it a city of extremes, it can be 45 degrees C in summer, the will dry up the moisture in your blood (I&rsquo;m just exaggerating here), or it can be torrential rains like this!! Well, despite all this, the city has a charm that most cities I have seen seem to have a lost. It is a big city, and yet you would still find that odd gentleman, who takes the time to stop and give you directions when you are lost, that friendly auto-rickshaw guy, you can within the span of 15 mins give you all that has been happening in Chennai in the last month!</p>

<p>Chennai, I have fallen for thee! Yup you are the &ldquo;Venice of Asia&rdquo; although it might be so for only 3 days in 10 years!</p>

<p>This is amazing.. Imagine being able to have a device implanted in your body, with which you cantrol with your thought, and which will use your brain as a hardrive, and use blood sugar as a battery cell.</p>

<p>Eerie thought envelop me, when I think of what could be?!! Living the matrix ?!!<br />
It is not only the body heat that can be a source of energy (like in &ldquo;The Matrix&rdquo;), even human blood sugar can be harnesed!</p>

<p>This better be a hoax, or I will have to shave my head for that pod implant and create space on the back of my skul for a USB port! Scary to think, that the next upgrade will have to be my brain (for lack of storage space!!)</p>

        <p>What are we humans against the over-powering wrath of mother nature? Time and again, she warns, and tests the best of us, and ceases to amaze us with the brute diplay of power. With all the technology in the world, man still has to grapple with reality of the powerlessness of the human being against forces of nature.</p>

<p>The recent display, in Pakistan and its surrounding, is simply astounding. One cannot, but feel empathy towards the innocent thousand (maybe millions) that have been trampled upon by the brute force of a 7.2 Earthquake.</p>

        <p>I need some ideas for my website and blog. I still have not been able to integrate and modify my blog well enough. Wordpress is great, but it sorely lacks some core CMS functionality, like for instance the ability to add pages to my site. I know you can add static pages, but I need to be able to create another changeable content page like what <a href="http://phpnuke.org">php-nuke</a> provides for instance.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m trying to organize some of the plugins and features I would like in my blog:</p>

<ul>
<li>Drop-down javascript box displaying relevant content - <a href="http://www.methodize.org/quicksub/#Download">quickSub</a></li>
<li>A plugin for displaying my bookshelf

<ul>
<li>what I have recently read/ reading and going to read)</li>
<li>link to my reviews if I have made any</li>
<li>create a new review for a book</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A front page like that of <a href="http://alexking.org/">Alex King</a></li>
<li>Link my pixelpost <a href="http://shvelmur.com/ppost/">photoblog </a>to wordpress</li>
</ul>

<p>I have no idea if there are any plugins that do what I want. while I keep searching for them, let me hope that someone leaves a link or two along to shorten my quest. Or else, one of these days, I might finally choose to get off my butt and learn php and hack away at wordpress</p>

        <p>What a lousy week it has been&hellip; I&rsquo;ve had this fever all week long, and is still poking its head around me now and then..</p>

<p>I have been down for the last few days with a viral fever. I also made the mistake of calling my family and telling them that I am unwell. They got very worried and came to Chennai in a taxi to pick me up (my mom). (That was embarrasing &hellip; but did feel well pampered).</p>

<p>I will be getting my new <a href="http://www.creative.com/products/product.asp?category=213&amp;subcategory=214&amp;product=10795">Creative Zen micro</a> (mp3 player) next week. Guru tell&rsquo;s me it sounds awesome. I hope he has got the [Sennheiser HD 202 headphones][1] I had him asked to buy. I&rsquo;m gonna have a ball of a time next week, when I can finally lay hands on some kewl gadgets that I&rsquo;ve been wanting to buy!</p>

        <p>As technology enters our lives, dare I say, invade our lives, the concept of radical design has been ubiquitous. It&rsquo;s design, design and more design, for last few days for me. I came across quite a few very kewl interfaces and design concepts (a detailed listing below). Some much of what we do, is so dependant on how efficiently a product has been designed. How minimal and useful the interface is.</p>

        <p>There was once a wondeful browser called &ldquo;Opera&rdquo;. The lucid interface, the smal memory footprint - it was simply browsing heaven.</p>

<p>Then came the version loaded with ads, heavy, sluggish UI and a hug memory footprint in the name of new improved UI. The ads loaded version of opera turned out to nag-ware and I totally detested it and moved to other browsers (read Firefox). Get online and check websites out became &ldquo;swimming&rdquo; and not &ldquo;surfing&rdquo;</p>

<p>Finally, the good old days are back! get the latest version of Opera sans ads for free.</p>

<p>I had a great time too, meeting a few new people, and a few new versions of old ones!<br />
The day we were returning to Chennai, we went to a kewl pub called &ldquo;Alibi&rdquo; in Church Street, where we managed to get two free pitchers of beer (try the Castle beer there &hellip; really neat!)</p>
