      <p>My site is probably one of the least visited blogs in the world! Trust me on that one! ;) by linking to the following set of youtube videos, I know I don't do much in making it reach more people, as it rightly deserves.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I consider it my responsibility to do it. and those of you who do read my blog, please do visit these vidoes and tell the author what you experienced.</p>

<p>It took me the whole of the weekend to get it into working shape, installing all the necessary open source tools that I use. Still a lot of work ahead. I hope to blog more since I have access to decent computing power where ever I go.</p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2007/01/got-my-hand-back-finally-3">Got my hand back, finally!</a></h1>

    <div id="post">
      <p>After a whole month, of wearing a cast, I got my hand back today. This is the first time, in 30 days that I am using both my hands to type and it feels good to be back (atleast partially).</p>
<p>Here are some pics of my hand.</p>
<p><a href="http://shvelmur.com/images/wpress/2d1d646124a3_FB22/DSC005915.jpg"><img width="240" height="180" align="left" src="/images/DSC00591_thumb2.jpg" /></a> That is the result of a 4 cm incision on my elbow, to re-align a 3 cm X 2 cm piece of cartiledge that had broken and had torn into my tricep. The doc says, that upto 10 cms of the tricep was torn by this piece. They have affixed this piece to my elbow with a screw to keep it in place.</p>
<p>I have to undergo a minimum of 5 days of physio therapy. I went for my first session today, and by far the worst part of breaking a bone, is doing physio! God it is painful to stretch your hand, after not moving it for a month. It is also very liberating that we get the faculty of using both hands!</p>
<p>I can imagine the struggle that those who are unfortunate to lose a limb, go through, to get through daily activities. I must thank my stars and all those who took great care of me.</p>
<p>Once again, at the risk of sounding very soapy, I thank all of you who kept me going.<br />
Here are some more pictures.</p>

    <div id="post">
      <p>Trying to get the Sony Ericsson W800i has been by far the most traumatic experience of my life. I tried everything possible, but still was unable to get it recognised on my home PC!</p>
<p>So, finally I decided to resort to the most reliable way to get anything to work with a PC. Do a google search!!!</p>
<p>Found a wonderful link, (on a forum that solved the issue). Here is the fix suggested, (I have organised in to be more of a step-by-step guide.</p>
<p>The following involves tampering with the Windows Registry. Kindly take a BACKUP of your registry using regedit before attempting any changes. Oh yeah.. you are on your own in case you screw up something.</p>
<p>EXPORT ALL THE KEYS MENTIONED BELOW BEFORE DELETING THEM! ALWAYS BEST TO HAVE A BACKUP</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure your phone is NOT connected to your computer.</li>
<li>Run Regedit.</li>
<li>Browse to "My ComputerHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESYSTEMCurrentControlSetEnumUSB"</li>
<li>Delete all key that start with "Vis_0fce&amp;Pid_d028".</li>
<li>You should be back to a stage where no w800 is installed on your machine.</li>
<li>Download the drivers (Approved ones) from SE's website under Support.</li>
<li>Run the EXE file and let it install.</li>
<li>Connect your phone through the USB cable.</li>
</ul>
