[{"content":"Introduction The Structured Object Definition Language (SODL) is a domain-specific language designed for defining data structures, relationships, and constraints in a clear and organized manner. Files written in SODL use the .sodl extension, reflecting the language\u0026rsquo;s focus on structured object definitions. SODL provides a rich set of constructs that allow developers to model complex data relationships while maintaining type safety and data integrity.\nThe name \u0026ldquo;Structured Object Definition Language\u0026rdquo; reflects the language\u0026rsquo;s core purpose: it provides a structured way to define objects and their relationships in a data model. The \u0026ldquo;Structured\u0026rdquo; aspect emphasizes its systematic approach to organizing data definitions, while \u0026ldquo;Object Definition\u0026rdquo; highlights its primary focus on defining data objects and their properties.\nWhen to Choose SODL SODL is particularly well-suited for:\nComplex data models with intricate relationships Systems requiring strong data validation Projects needing clear documentation of data structures Applications with strict type safety requirements Systems with complex business rules around data integrity The language\u0026rsquo;s focus on structured definitions makes it especially valuable in enterprise environments where data modeling clarity and maintainability are crucial.\nCore Concepts Basic Building Blocks SODL uses several fundamental building blocks to construct data models:\nBasic Types: The language supports various numeric types (uint8 through uint64, int8 through int64, float32, float64), strings, booleans, and timestamps. These serve as the foundation for more complex data structures.\nComplex Types: SODL supports fixed-size lists ([Type; size]) and TLV (Type-Length-Value) structures (tlv\u0026lt;Type\u0026gt;), allowing for more sophisticated data organization.\nUser-Defined Types: Developers can create custom types using several constructs, which we\u0026rsquo;ll explore in detail.\nImport System SODL features a modular import system that allows code reuse and organization. The syntax supports:\n1 import { UUID, Timestamp } from \u0026#34;common_types\u0026#34; This system allows for:\nSelective imports with specific type names Wildcard imports using * Import aliasing for naming flexibility Core Constructs 1. Enums Enums provide a way to define a set of named constants. Each enum value can optionally have an explicit integer value:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 enum UserRole { Admin = 1, Editor = 2, Viewer = 3, Guest = 4 } 2. Unions Unions represent a type that could be one of several possibilities. They\u0026rsquo;re particularly useful for modeling variable data types:\n1 2 3 4 5 union ContactMethod { Email, Phone, Address } 3. Structs Structs are collections of fields, each with its own type. They\u0026rsquo;re used to create compound data types:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 struct Address { street: string, city: string, state: string, zipCode: string, country: string } 4. Keys Keys define unique identifiers and indexing structures. They can include multiple fields and metadata:\n1 2 3 4 5 key UserProfile { userId: type = UUID, username: type = string, email: type = string } 5. Objects Objects are the most complex and feature-rich construct in SODL. They represent entities with various properties and constraints:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 object UserAccount { userId: type = UUID, assigned = counter, required, key; username: type = string, required; email: type = string, required; profile: type = UserProfile; } Object fields can have several properties:\nrequired: Field must have a value key: Field is part of the object\u0026rsquo;s key assigned: Specifies automatic value assignment default: Provides a default value optional: Field may be omitted 6. KeyMaps KeyMaps define relationships between different objects using their keys:\n1 2 3 4 keymap UserProfile:UserAccount { username -\u0026gt; username, email -\u0026gt; email }, primary, name = \u0026#34;ProfileToAccount\u0026#34;; KeyMaps support properties like:\nprimary: Indicates a primary relationship name: Provides a descriptive name cascadeDelete: Specifies deletion behavior Advanced Features Type Constraints SODL supports advanced type constraints:\nRange constraints: range(min, max) Pattern matching: pattern = \u0026quot;regex_pattern\u0026quot; Strict Mode Fields can be marked as strict with explicit values:\n1 field: string, strict = \u0026#34;specific_value\u0026#34; Common Patterns and Best Practices Hierarchical Data Modeling Create clear hierarchies using objects and relationships. The example shows this with UserAccount and UserPreferences.\nRelationship Modeling Use KeyMaps to establish clear relationships between entities. The example demonstrates this with organization membership.\nType Safety Leverage the type system to ensure data integrity. The example uses specific types like UUID and Timestamp.\nGaps in the Example The provided example could be enhanced with:\nPattern Constraints The example doesn\u0026rsquo;t show usage of pattern matching for strings (e.g., email validation).\nRange Constraints Numeric range constraints aren\u0026rsquo;t demonstrated (e.g., age limits).\nTLV Types The example doesn\u0026rsquo;t utilize TLV types, which could be useful for variable-length data.\nNested Complex Types While it shows arrays of structs, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t demonstrate nested arrays or more complex type combinations.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s an example of what these missing features might look like:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 object EnhancedUserProfile { email: string, pattern = \u0026#34;^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$\u0026#34;; age: uint8, range(13, 120); metadata: tlv\u0026lt;string\u0026gt;; skills: [string; 10]; certifications: [[string; 2]; 5]; // Array of certification pairs } Common Pitfalls to Avoid Overuse of Optional Fields While optional fields provide flexibility, overusing them can lead to data inconsistency.\nComplex Key Structures Keep key structures simple and focused on natural identifying properties.\nMissing Relationships Ensure all necessary relationships are properly modeled using KeyMaps.\nComparison with Other Data Definition Languages SODL vs Protocol Buffers (protobuf) Type System\nSODL: Provides more precise numeric types (uint8-uint64, int8-int64) and built-in support for timestamps Protobuf: Simpler type system with fewer numeric types, requires manual timestamp handling Relationship Modeling\nSODL: First-class support for relationships through KeyMaps Protobuf: Relationships must be modeled through message references Validation\nSODL: Built-in support for range constraints and pattern matching Protobuf: Limited validation capabilities, requires additional tooling Schema Evolution\nSODL: Explicit strict/optional field marking Protobuf: Built-in versioning through field numbers SODL vs JSON Schema Structure\nSODL: More concise syntax, focused on object definitions JSON Schema: More verbose, JSON-based syntax Type Safety\nSODL: Strong static typing with precise numeric types JSON Schema: Dynamic typing with broader type categories Validation\nSODL: Built-in constraints with a focus on data integrity JSON Schema: Extensive validation capabilities but more complex syntax Tooling\nSODL: Purpose-built for data modeling with relationship support JSON Schema: Broader ecosystem with various validation tools SODL vs SQL DDL Focus\nSODL: Object-oriented data modeling with rich relationships SQL DDL: Relational data modeling with tables and foreign keys Constraints\nSODL: Built-in support for range and pattern constraints SQL DDL: Extensive constraint system with CHECK clauses Type System\nSODL: Consistent cross-platform types SQL DDL: Database-specific type systems Relationships\nSODL: KeyMaps provide flexible relationship modeling SQL DDL: Foreign key constraints with referential integrity SODL vs GraphQL Schema Purpose\nSODL: Focus on data modeling and storage GraphQL: Focus on API design and query patterns Type System\nSODL: Rich built-in types with constraints GraphQL: Simpler type system with custom scalar support Relationships\nSODL: Explicit relationship modeling through KeyMaps GraphQL: Implicit relationships through field types Validation\nSODL: Built-in validation constraints GraphQL: Requires custom directive implementation Key Advantages of SODL Precision in Data Modeling\nFine-grained type system Built-in constraint support Clear relationship modeling Data Integrity\nStrong validation capabilities Explicit strict/optional field marking Type safety across implementations Maintainability\nClear, readable syntax Modular import system Structured relationship definitions Flexibility\nSupport for various data modeling patterns Rich type composition Extensible through imports SODL vs Apache Parquet While SODL and Parquet might seem very different at first glance, they both deal with data structure definition and organization, albeit for different purposes and at different stages of the data lifecycle. Let\u0026rsquo;s explore their similarities and differences:\nPrimary Purpose\nSODL serves as a language for defining data structures and relationships at the application and service level, focusing on how data should be organized and validated during its active use. Parquet, on the other hand, is a columnar storage format designed for efficient data storage and retrieval, particularly for analytical workloads.\nSchema Definition Approach\nSODL provides a rich, human-readable syntax for defining complex data structures with relationships and constraints. Here\u0026rsquo;s how a simple user record might look in SODL:\n1 2 3 4 5 object User { userId: type = UUID, assigned = counter, required, key; age: type = uint8, range(0, 120); email: type = string, pattern = \u0026#34;^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$\u0026#34;; } Parquet schemas are typically defined using message type definitions in protocol buffers style:\n1 2 3 4 5 message User { required binary user_id (UTF8); required int32 age; required binary email (UTF8); } Data Organization\nSODL focuses on logical organization:\nHierarchical structure through nested objects Explicit relationship definitions via KeyMaps Support for complex types and constraints Focus on data integrity and validation Parquet focuses on physical organization:\nColumnar storage for better compression Column chunks and row groups Statistics and encoding at the column level Optimization for read performance Type System\nSODL provides:\nFine-grained numeric types (uint8 through uint64) Built-in support for complex types like UUID and Timestamp User-defined types and unions Constraint definitions within the type system Parquet supports:\nBasic types (INT32, INT64, FLOAT, DOUBLE, BOOLEAN) Encoded types through logical types Repeated and required fields Limited validation capabilities Use Cases\nSODL is ideal for:\nApplication data model definition Service interface contracts Data validation rules Relationship modeling Business logic constraints Parquet excels at:\nBig data storage Analytical query optimization Data warehousing Column-oriented processing Compression efficiency Schema Evolution\nSODL handles evolution through:\nExplicit optional/required field marking Strict mode for field values Import system for type reuse Clear relationship versioning through KeyMaps Parquet manages evolution through:\nAdding/removing optional fields Column addition/removal Schema merging capabilities Backward compatibility support Complementary Usage\nSODL and Parquet often complement each other in a data pipeline:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [Application Layer] SODL Definitions - Define data structure - Validate input - Manage relationships ↓ [Processing Layer] Data Transformation - Convert to columnar format - Optimize for analytics ↓ [Storage Layer] Parquet Storage - Efficient storage - Fast analytical queries Performance Characteristics SODL focuses on:\nCompile-time type safety Runtime validation efficiency Relationship integrity Memory-efficient representations Parquet optimizes for:\nDisk space efficiency Read performance for analytical queries CPU efficiency in data processing Memory efficiency in column handling Integration Patterns A typical integration might look like this:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 // SODL definition for active data object AnalyticsEvent { eventId: type = UUID, assigned = counter, required, key; timestamp: type = Timestamp, required; userId: type = UUID, required; eventType: type = string, required; properties: type = tlv\u0026lt;string\u0026gt;;## When to Choose SODL SODL is particularly well-suited for: 1. Complex data models with intricate relationships 2. Systems requiring strong data validation 3. Projects needing clear documentation of data structures 4. Applications with strict type safety requirements 5. Systems with complex business rules around data integrity The language\u0026#39;s focus on structured definitions makes it especially valuable in enterprise environments where data modeling clarity and maintainability are crucial. // required binary key (UTF8); // required binary value (UTF8); // } // } // } This comparison highlights how SODL and Parquet serve different but complementary roles in a data architecture. SODL provides the rich, constrainable schema definitions needed for application-level data modeling, while Parquet offers the optimized storage format needed for analytical processing. Understanding these differences helps architects and developers choose the right tool for each part of their data pipeline.\nConclusion SODL provides a robust framework for data modeling with strong typing and relationship management. Its structured approach to object definition makes it particularly well-suited for projects that require clear, maintainable data models while enforcing data integrity and structure. The .sodl file extension helps identify these definition files within a project\u0026rsquo;s codebase, making it easier to manage and organize data models.\n","permalink":"http://blog.shiv.me/projects/sodl/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"introduction\"\u003eIntroduction\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Structured Object Definition Language (SODL) is a domain-specific language designed for defining data structures, relationships, and constraints in a clear and organized manner.

It a quick walk-through of the unique features in Elixir for someone coming from years of C \u0026mdash; a way for me to remember and use as a reference.\nSummary Types Operators Control Structures Types Atoms Named contants with a value. true and false are atoms.\nStrings Supports unicode string natively! It\u0026rsquo;s about time. 1 You can concatenate strings using \u0026lt;\u0026gt;. \u0026quot;hello\u0026quot; \u0026lt;\u0026gt; \u0026quot; world\u0026quot;. Anonymous functions Native support for closures \u0026ndash; called anonymous functions. Also, functions are first-class, i.e. can be passed as arguments into other functions. Special syntax is required to invoke ananymous functions.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 iex(1)\u0026gt; add = fn a,b -\u0026gt; a + b end #Function\u0026lt;12.52032458/2 in :erl_eval.expr/5\u0026gt; iex(2)\u0026gt; add.(1,2) 3 iex(3)\u0026gt; mulby2 = fn a -\u0026gt; add.(a,a) end #Function\u0026lt;6.52032458/1 in :erl_eval.expr/5\u0026gt; iex(4)\u0026gt; mulby2.(4) 8 iex(5)\u0026gt; Lists Native support for lists. hd(list) and tl(list). A list of printable characters will be output as a string. Slower linear access to data, but really fast to prepend elements to the list. eg. [ 0 | list].\nTuples Native support for associative arrays. Any pair of values, stored contiguously. Indexes start from zero. mutable put_elem(tuple, idx, \u0026quot;value\u0026quot;). Fast access, but expensive to add or insert elements\nKeyword Lists Lists of tuples where\nKeys must be atoms. Keys are ordered, as specified by the developer. Keys can be given more than once. Useful for making DSLs.\nElixir has special syntax for keyword lists\n1 2 3 4 iex\u0026gt; list = [{:a, 1}, {:b, 2}] [a: 1, b: 2] iex\u0026gt; list ++ [c: 3] [a: 1, b: 2, c: 3] the Keyword module provides methods to manipulate keyword lists.\nMaps 2 For a key-value store, maps are the “go to” data structure in Elixir. A map is created using the %{} syntax:\nMaps allow any value as a key. Maps’ keys do not follow any ordering. Matches a subset of a given value. 1 2 3 4 iex\u0026gt; map = %{:a =\u0026gt; 1, 2 =\u0026gt; :b} %{2 =\u0026gt; :b, :a =\u0026gt; 1} iex\u0026gt; map[:a] 1 Matches as long as a key is found in the map. 1 2 3 4 5 6 iex\u0026gt; %{:a =\u0026gt; a} = %{:a =\u0026gt; 1, 2 =\u0026gt; :b} %{2 =\u0026gt; :b, :a =\u0026gt; 1} iex\u0026gt; a 1 iex\u0026gt; n = 1 1 Variables can be used when accessing, matching and adding keys 1 2 3 4 5 6 iex\u0026gt; map = %{n =\u0026gt; :one} %{1 =\u0026gt; :one} iex\u0026gt; map[n] :one iex\u0026gt; %{^n =\u0026gt; :one} = %{1 =\u0026gt; :one, 2 =\u0026gt; :two, 3 =\u0026gt; :three} %{1 =\u0026gt; :one, 2 =\u0026gt; :two, 3 =\u0026gt; :three} If all the keys are atoms, convienience syntax may be used. 1 2 3 4 5 iex\u0026gt; map = %{:a =\u0026gt; 1, 2 =\u0026gt; :b} %{2 =\u0026gt; :b, :a =\u0026gt; 1} iex\u0026gt; map.a 1 The Map module provides a very similar API to the Keyword module with convenience functions to manipulate maps.\nNested data structures Elixir supported special functions for working with nested structures. xpath like addressing into a specific level in a nested struct\nput_in/2 update_in/2 get_update_in/2 Dynamic variants of the above:\nput_in/3 update_in/3 get_update_in/3 Other types Port, Reference and PID\nOperators Note that ===, and !== use type when comparing (thankfully, the defaults are sensible)\n+, - , ++, \u0026ndash;, \u0026lt;\u0026gt; (concatenate) and, or, not \u0026amp;\u0026amp;, ||, ! ==, !=, === (more strict), !== (more strict), \u0026lt;=, \u0026gt;=, \u0026lt; and \u0026gt; nil/false == false (everything else is true) The match operator (=) Used to assign result of an operation to a variable. Can also be used to assign a tuple or list to a set of variables.\n1 2 3 {a, b, c} = {:hello, \u0026#34;world\u0026#34;, 42} [a, b, c] = [1, 2, 3] [head | tail] = [1, 2, 3] # head = [1], tail = [2, 3] The pin operator (^) Useful when there is a need to check one of the values of list, but assign another.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 iex\u0026gt; x = 1 1 iex\u0026gt; x = 2 2 iex\u0026gt; x = 1 1 iex\u0026gt; ^x = 2 ** (MatchError) no match of right hand side value: 2 The _ operator Ignore the rest, or assign the rest to _\n1 2 3 4 iex\u0026gt; [h | _] = [1, 2, 3] [1, 2, 3] iex\u0026gt; h 1 The pipe operator left |\u0026gt; right, passes left as a parameter to the right. It is useful to re-write code be easier to read. The following are the same:\n1 2 3 4 5 iex\u0026gt; Enum.sum(Enum.filter(Enum.map(1..100_000, \u0026amp;(\u0026amp;1 * 3)), odd?)) 7500000000 iex\u0026gt; 1..100_000 |\u0026gt; Enum.map(\u0026amp;(\u0026amp;1 * 3)) |\u0026gt; Enum.filter(odd?) |\u0026gt; Enum.sum 7500000000 Control Structures case - check for multiple matches. cond - check for multiple conditions. if, else, end - check for specific condition. unless - check for a specific match. 3 Elixir allows a lot of variations of guards that are used in conditional to express conditions. See here for more information.\ndo/end - the syntax is a bit weird, but quite similar to do..while in C.

It is written in ruby, has some cool features. Overall, it is a decent solution, but I was never satisfied with options it provided. I have hesistated to hack at it, since ruby isn\u0026rsquo;t my language-du-jour, and most of the changes have been quite minimal. It is also extremely slow1.\nAs any self-respecting programmer is wont to do, instead of writing more posts, and meeting my goal, I delved right into fixing \u0026ldquo;bike-shed\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; in this case, research and use a new static-site generator. Why, you ask? To you, non-existent, ever-questioning inquisitive you, I say \u0026ndash; Why not?!\nAs with any successful hunt, one must make a list: One that shall help determine settle the battle of the generators.\nMust be fast \u0026ndash; I mean blazing. Must be in one of the languages I currently hack in: go, nim, c, c++, javascript, python, rust, erlang Should have good defaults \u0026ndash; shouldn\u0026rsquo;t need plugins to perform basic features: syntax highlighting, responsive images, theming, permalinks and good markdown support. Should have a few good themes Good community support and/or documents The contenders Scouring the corners of the internet, I narrowed down on two final choices: Hexo and Hugo.\nNew shiny, shiny They\nare faster at generating 300+ pages. are opinionated and hence have good defaults. support most of features I am looking for except responsive images. provide extended markdown support by default. hosted by an active community. Hugo FTW! Both Hugo and Hexo are pretty good. They are fast enough for my use, and are implemented in modern languages that I am actively learning.\nHugo edged out Hexo: It has a few features that look promising and is a bit more fun to hack. It is written in go and this make it ideal. I am switching to Go as a primary language for my hacking needs. A lot of issues, and about 3000 forks is a good opportunity to contribute to a larg-ish project in go!\nThe choice is made. Now to move the herd. I have the daunting task of migrating 300+ posts that were originally posted on different blog engines of the past: blogger, wordpress, and octopress and finally jekyll.\nSlow is relative.

To compound, my 6\u0026rsquo; 5\u0026quot; (196 cm) frame does not mix well with cramped spaces.\nDan Kois on Slate, says\neveryone on the plane would be better off if no one reclined; the minor gain in comfort when you tilt your seat back 5 degrees is certainly offset by the discomfort when the person in front of you does the same. But of course someone always will recline her seat, like the people in the first row, or the woman in front of me, whom I hate. (At least we\u0026rsquo;re not in the middle seat.

My legs are up against the back of your seat, and if you do, my knees will be crushed.\u0026rdquo;\nPotential Recliner: \u0026ldquo;Sure!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;\n*[2 hours later]: The seat reclines *\nMe: \u0026ldquo;Gaaaa!!!\u0026rdquo;\nIn the four legs of the journey, if I get one \u0026ldquo;recliner\u0026rdquo; in the seat in front of me, I usually spend about 10 hours standing. Yes, I used to pay for my seat, and stand all the way through.\nFor the love of god, next time, maybe a quick check might be a good idea before you decide to recline. This way, you will help save crushed knees of some poor-souls.\nNote: Cathay Pacific has an interesting solution. Their shell seats mean no reclining!.\nLater: I spoke too soon!

Ideas in the form of text, video (granted there wasn\u0026rsquo;t much back then), music. That desire to learn new things, and to \u0026ldquo;consume\u0026rdquo; content has not abated in the last decade and a half.\nLast week, I was mentioning to a colleague that I had to \u0026ldquo;download\u0026rdquo; a particular album by a new artist since it was unavailable in the US (both iTunes, and in store), and the conversation moved to the ethics of doing such a thing.\nHow can one, in the world today, justify \u0026ldquo;pirating\u0026rdquo; a song, when there is so many ways of getting, said product?\nIn my opinion, the cost of virtual goods (videos, movies, music, pod-casts, articles) are higher than their perceived value by the consumer.\nWith these images on the internet, the cost of storage, distribution, and revenue generation is almost zero. Yet an album is still priced around $10-$20. In such an environment, scarcity is pre-dominantly artificial, whether it created by DRM or regional restrictions or pricing schemes, only serve to fuel piracy.\nIn my case, I would have gladly paid for it on iTunes, but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t available there. It was available on Spotify, but of course, that is not available in Canada (it\u0026rsquo;s only been 3 years since the rest of the world has access to it). So my choice is between being denied access to content I\u0026rsquo;m willing to pay for, or fire up a browser, find the torrent, and download it. Guess which one I chose?\nFred Wilson, says it better than I can ever hope to (seems like he had a similar problem, and found the same solution):\nI understand their muscle memory in terms of the scarcity business model. But restricting access to content is a bad business model in the age of a global network that costs practically nothing to distribute on.\nvia A VC: Scarcity Is A Shitty Business Model.\nWe, humans are creative beings, and we will always seek the shortest, fastest, cheapest path to creative content. We can make it illegal, but we can\u0026rsquo;t stop people from reaching out to their fundamental impulses. Perhaps it is time we change the way we have organized how we make money from those impulses.\n","permalink":"http://blog.shiv.me/posts/2012/2012-01-16-piracy-for-convenience/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn the wild days of 1996, when I got my hands on a computer (it cost about a year\u0026rsquo;s worth of my Dad\u0026rsquo;s salary, and nothing that I am would have been possible but for that sacrifice he made), I was enamored by the ease of content consumption on a computer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn one year, I went from knowing nothing about the world, to interacting with hundreds of other people across the world, talking about different things, and experiencing new content every day.

It\u0026rsquo;s been fun. It has replaced every other device I own (ie, a couple of PCs and the nexus one). It\u0026rsquo;s an outright winner, when it comes to reading, especially long-form articles, and books alike. It has become my go-to machine for everyday news, twitter/facebook, and even for browsing my favorite photographers.\nIt have however remained strictly in the realm of content consumption \u0026ndash; until now. In the last few days, I\u0026rsquo;ve added a stylus - the Targus iPad stylus (available quite readily at most \u0026lsquo;best-buy\u0026rsquo;s, and on Amazon), and the iPad\u0026rsquo;s camera connect kit. If you own an iPad (v1 or v2) I would recommend that you fork out the moolah for these two. It will be the best $50 you\u0026rsquo;ll ever spend on accessories for the iPad. Forget the cool looking smart cover. These will be more rewarding than the 2 hours of thrill of watching the smart cover turn off the ipad when you close it.\nThe targus stylus is without doubt the best one in the market yet. It\u0026rsquo;s got good heft to it. Feels comfortable to hold. The only gripe I have with the Targus is the length. I can\u0026rsquo;t but wonder why they didn\u0026rsquo;t make it same as a standard pencil.\nThere is no contest between this, and the Pogo Sketch. (Ten-one design could be the next Wacom, if they get their pressure sensitive stylus right. Wacom should buy them out, now, before they get too big). The targus has an air-filled bubble for the tip, which slides with less resistance against the iPad\u0026rsquo;s screen, than the spongy one of the pogo sketch. The tip is still fairly large, and the level of control you get varies by the app. If you use Penultimate, this stylus will provide much better control. The iPad can now actually replace paper \u0026amp; pen (somewhat). I can\u0026rsquo;t wait to see how good the Wacom stylus is going to be. It will definitely cost more (around $40 if I\u0026rsquo;m right), but for $20, this is the best stylus (that is also readily available) right now.\nThe camera connect kit, is a thing of marvel. It is not like Apple to allow such a wide range of applications for a single piece of plastic (even if it is over-priced for something that should be part of the iPad purchase). I just found out that it works quite well with my camera (a Canon 7D). Importing RAW images onto the iPad are faster than importing them on my MacbookPro (something seriously out-of-whack here \u0026ndash; I\u0026rsquo;ll need to investigate, to confirm this). It also allows connecting any \u0026ldquo;Mac\u0026rdquo; supported keyboard (I\u0026rsquo;m typing this post on my logitech USB Wave keyboard, which I must say kicks the pants off any keyboard Apple currently sells). Of course, carrying a keyboard around is out of question, but it\u0026rsquo;s nice to know it works without any special drivers.\nTip: Both Ctrl+shift+arrows (begin/end of line), and Cmd+shift+arrows (1-word at a time) allow you to select text on iPad. of course, you can navigate around the text, if you don\u0026rsquo;t use shift. No, someone needs to port vim to iOS. That would be awesome.\nThe killer combo of the week, was a little hard to choose. Here are two:\nTargus Stylus + Penultimate Blogsy + iPad Camera connect kit + Logitech Wave keyboard Photosmith looks like a promising app. Currently, it is metadata management and import app, that syncs with Lightroom via Wifi. $20 is quite reasonable for an app that will allow automatic import into lightroom. However, I\u0026rsquo;m unconvinced with the design. I wish they would provide better selection capabilities. I\u0026rsquo;d buy it in a heartbeat, if they allowed multi-select+tagging or some kind of paint interface that can apply a group of tag+collection info that I define.\n","permalink":"http://blog.shiv.me/posts/2011/2011-05-01-ipad-and-friends/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://blog.shiv.me/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/20110501-112322.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"20110501-112322.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/20110501-112322.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s been a year since I \u003ca href=\"http://blog.shiv.me/2010/05/29/icaved.html\"\u003esold my kidneys for an iPad\u003c/a\u003e.

A very interesting, clean product. Shawn Taylor is the founder, and he is getting geared up. This is has the potential to be huge, especially in Vancouver. HTML5 - a great talk by John Baxall, CEO @ Mobify. One of the best talks, and a great intro into the world of feature detection on browsers. OpenRestaurants - a vision to make restaurant websites suck less. Fingers crossed that this will happen sooner. We can all use better access to data (and not keep it behind walls .. I\u0026rsquo;m looking at you Facebook) FashionQuest - Text-only adventure game engine. Aahh this brought back some memories. A very interesting use of YAML (In my world, it\u0026rsquo;s used as modelling language for NETCONF) Freaking Eyes EyePong- Control an ipad app with your eyes (This stuff just blew my mind. Playing pong with just your eyes is incredible, not to mention the zillion possibilities) Symphony CMS - an XSLT based open source wiki. Another hallway demo. If you work for a large company, and your current CMS sucks, give this a looksie. Some people that I got a chance to chat with. Friend \u0026rsquo;em up on twitter. Check out their projects/websites.

The last 20 days have been insane, and ofcourse to a take a break from writing code, I like to read code that others write. (You DO know that I\u0026rsquo;m crazy, right?!). In one of my futile attempts at clearing my google-reader reading list, I chanced upon a post by Veerabahu, on finding if a number is a power of 2 (or not).\nAs he writes, there is the simpleton O(n) solution (you will have to click-through for that), and the most elegant (yet) bitwise solution:\n/* */ bool is_power_of_2(int n) { return ((n \u0026amp; -n) == n); } The bitwise way to calculate the power of 2 is probably the most efficient in c like languages. Ofcourse for that, your language of choice needs to support it and should be more efficient that common math functions. The other way is to use some simple math.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s say N, is the value, and you need to check if it is a power of two. Compute n = log N / log 2. If floor(n) == n, then N was a power of 2.\n/* */ bool is_power_of_2_pure_math_baby(int n) { /* address -ve numbers */ if (n \u0026lt; 0) n = -n; double i = log(n)/log(2); /* i = power of 2 */ return (lower(i) == i); /* check if perfect power of 2 */ } This is obviously, a less efficient way of checking if a number is a power of 2, than using the bitwise method. However, it has a few advantages:\nIt works exactly the same way for all values of n. It works exactly the same way for all integers (ie, n can be int8/16/32/64, long, signed or unsigned, and the same logic would work It is O(1) like the bitwise solution It is less cryptic (ie just basic understanding of math is reqd for grokking this solution) Finally, it can be extended in future to calculate if n is a power of *any value*, not just 2 Of course, the point Josh Bloch was making in interviewing engineers, was that he is interested in knowing the WHY of a solution. It does not matter if the algorithm is marginally less optimal or different. If you are an interviewer in your organisation, and you catch yourself asking a question like this, remember that if an engineer can reduce O(n) to O(1), stop with similar micro-skills test. Find out why she coded it the way she did. It will tell you a lot more about her skills than some algorithms/tricks that can be picked up in acouple a days, if not overnight.\n","permalink":"http://blog.shiv.me/posts/2010/2010-11-03-power/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s been a while since I\u0026rsquo;ve done anything except write code \u0026ndash; lots of it.

Example sales, money, hours, are all unsigned. 13 Jul 2010 from TweetDeck in reply to shiva\n\u0026ndash; this quote was brought to you by quoteurl\nJava is, by no means, a \u0026ldquo;new\u0026rdquo; language for anyone I know. However, we still try to write C/C++ like code using it. We approach it with all of the training of C/C++, and start micro-optimisation much before it is needed, and end up with hard to comprehend complex code.\nI thought I will write a long-winded post about why unsigned int is not available in Java, and how to emulate it if you really need to, but I will leave that to more able hands.\nThe reason for lack of unsigned types in Java are:\n1. The core of the Java language was designed to be simple. This meant leaving out anything that adds complexity that can be done without. unsigned types didn\u0026rsquo;t make the cut\n2. Someone got lazy and didn\u0026rsquo;t bother to implement them, when the time came to make Oak into Java. (I wish leaving things out like this happen more in the industry).\nNow, let\u0026rsquo;s examine why one requires unsigned types:\n1. Represent business case values like salary or percentile etc\n2. Store bitsets \u0026ndash; each bit representing some state or option\n3. provide the ability to store more value that one can in an signed, thereby requiring lesser in-memory size\nCase 1 is a no brainer: As long as the value fits within the bounds of a 32-bit integer, you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t care. Unless you need to store a value greater than 2,147,483,647, you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t care if it is signed or unsigned.\nCase 2 is a hack: This is a typical carry-over from the C world, where there are no true enum or bitset types. If you need this, consider using an Enum or BitSet (as the case be for the problem you are trying to address)\nCase 3 is a delusion, and a sin: To a certain extent this is also something that was necessary and a good thing in C, and almost useless, and sometimes wrong to do in Java. The cost and the risk of implementing a type, particularly one that will require, new arithmetic semantics to be written, is never justified. The less new language syntax one invents, the simpler the code is. My rule of thumb is \u0026ndash; if I\u0026rsquo;m extending the language, I delete that class, and re-write it to use only existing semantics. If that means re-writing 5 other classes, so be it. In the long run, that yields a better, compact, and clean system.\nNow contrast that, with using a signed int, where you expect the value to be unsigned. Unless you need to store a value greater than 2,147,483,647 there is no reason or benefit for implementing an unsigned int. Even in that case, unless you expect that to be marshalled to a system implemented in another language (like C/C++) via rpc, you should be using a long.\nThe next time you get the urge to extend the Java language, by defining a class that the language left out \u0026ndash; think twice if you really need it. If, after deliberation, you still think you need it, implement it, use it in your code, delete the implementation and re-write your code. Trust me, it won\u0026rsquo;t have affected the application much, but your code will be cleaner and simpler to understand.\nThat is worth every extra-line of non-resuable code that you write.\nPeace.\n-Shiva\n","permalink":"http://blog.shiv.me/posts/2010/2010-07-13-why-no-unsigned-int-in-java/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAn interesting thing for me, is that if I am active on twitter during daytime in India (now that I\u0026rsquo;m here on vacation), I get to have some interesting conversations about design and development.

There is something geeky about seeing crappy fonts on a screen, that makes one want to use a tool more.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve known of the OPML editor for a few years now, and have tried several times to find a neat use-case for it in my workflow, and it never had a compelling enough reason for me to stick with it. I\u0026rsquo;m hoping that this new wordpress editor tool will make me want to use this more.\nThis is the first post that I\u0026rsquo;m writing using OPMLEditor, and here are some of the impressions in the first 30 minutes of use. This is by no means a thorough analysis, and is mostly off the top of my head.\nSome cool things:\nVery simple elegant interface, that let\u0026rsquo;s you focus on writing content Updating an existing post, is as simple as opening a window, and starting to type. This also allows for micro-updates. As I typed this post, I save atleast 3 times. Since my blog has RSSCLoud and PubSubHubBub (sucky name), every time I hit save, you happen to be online, you will receive an update. Some annoyances:\nHTML markup when you decide to mark up your page. Since I\u0026rsquo;m a geek, I guess I don\u0026rsquo;t mind this, although I would like to be able to use my favourite markup syntax, like Markdown. Non-standard menu layout =\u0026gt; I need to search for stuff. This is pain, until I learnt the ropes a bit (all of 15 mins), and I figured out how to use it. I don\u0026rsquo;t like to take my hands of the keyboard very often, and I tend to shy away from tools that make me do it. Unfortunately, there are no default shortcuts for the simple functionality like adding a link or making something bold, etc. On the one hand, this means, that I will complete writing all that I want to write and then make it pretty. Although, I might get used to working this way, I would still be able to do most of the annotation using just the keyboard. I hope that there is someway to acheive this. I might be wrong about this, so don\u0026rsquo;t stone me over this. ;) Another really annoying thing, every time I press enter, it OPMLEditor starts a new outline, which is great for outlining, but when I try to create a list of items, it sucks \u0026ndash; big time. For instance, see how it is horrible to view this list in the editor. If need to change one element, I will need to look at much more of the text, just to figure out where to change it. This can be solved by allowing multiple lines in the editor (using shift+enter), and ignoring those when converting to HTML. Images have to handle independant of the post creation. I so, wish that the OPML, can also publish the img with the post, but I think Wordpress doesn\u0026rsquo;t provide XMLRPC API for such upload. I posted the image on this post on dropbox, which to a certain extent mitigates this issue, since all you have to do, is use something Skitch to take a screenshot and move it a public dropbox folder. Right-click the image, and you can copy the public link of that image, in finder. Another Cmd-tab, brings you back to the editing context, and few more clicks later, you have placed your image in the post. It\u0026rsquo;s a pain, but it is better than waiting for the image to upload, etc.. It creates tables for every item in an outline!! This is going to be a very big problem for me, since this means mixing presentation with data so much, that it will be impossible for me to parse this out later, if I just need to get the data. I don\u0026rsquo;t understand, why what is being done using tables, can\u0026rsquo;t be done using paragraphs instead?!

It might just inspire some more thought\nPerson 1: You know I\u0026rsquo;m beginning to believe that each time something hits us hard - there\u0026rsquo;s going to be a lovely gift - only thing you don\u0026rsquo;t see it right away.

If you start believing that everything that hits you hard (or for that matter, everything) results in some unknown good, does it then even hit you as hard?! It is a wonderfully recursive mechanism, where a little bit of trust in life removes a little bit of the need to \u0026ldquo;safeguard\u0026rdquo; oneself, which in turn adds a little bit of trust in life.\nOfcourse, the minute you realize this, the whole recursive chain could unfold, and the transformation can be instantaneous. :) So it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to take years, one just needs to reach a critical level of trust in life or a critical level of understanding that life itself is inconsequential and therefore, the only thing of consequence is how well one can live it \u0026ldquo;in the now\u0026rdquo;\nSo what do you think about that? Any comments? thoughts?! Or do you think it is just hippy shit?!\nI\u0026rsquo;m fascinated by the beauty of Miss Gardot\u0026rsquo;s voice, and the strength it took to get it back.

Obviously, some are elated at this proposition, some tentative, and then there are some others who think all of this is just hogwash.\nI have but one thing to show you today. Presenting article number 1, a video by one of the minions at Google.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a tip: people on Times Square have no, frigging, clue of what a browser is. Don\u0026rsquo;t even get me started on, where the OS stops and the browser starts. The people you are trying to sell this to, don\u0026rsquo;t give a shit. The people who do know what a browser is, think you are just crap-shooting them.\nOh, since I do know what a browser is, considering that I\u0026rsquo;ve used one since 95, I will say, that writing a shell on a linux kernel, and distributing it with only one app, does not make it an OS. It is a linux distro. I\u0026rsquo;m sure the following are familiar: Ubuntu, RedHat, Suse (Novell), which are all the same as Google Chrome (or atleast what they say it will be).\nSo Google, stop messing with things that don\u0026rsquo;t make you money and go fix that bug in Gmail or Google reader or maybe you can add RSS support to blogs on blogspot (the rest of the sane world did that only 5 years ago). We, who use your \u0026ldquo;free\u0026rdquo; ad-filled products will be very pleased. Oh yeah, while you are at it, figure out a way to monetize those millions you invested in wonderful companies (Remember youtube, jaiku, jotspot, dodgeball, orkut, grandcentral ?! ). You might also want to consider improving this thing you helped invent \u0026ndash; search. I hear that there is a new-comer.

I always tend to answer that question with: it depends.\nJust like any other algorithm, there is no silver bullet. It is a trade off between CPU and memory utilisation. Sometimes, we do have to think about these things (this is code in c++ on a device with scarce resources, to say the least).\nOf course, the simplest solution for this would be to use multiple for loops:\n**// merge - version 1** function List\u0026lt;C\u0026gt; merge(List\u0026lt;A\u0026gt; l1, List\u0026lt;B\u0026gt; l2) {\n// oh god! I shouldn't be doing this for(A a: l1) { C c = new C(a); for(B b: l2) { if (c.foo == b.foo) { c.add(b); } } } } As is obvious any half-decent programmer would shudder at the thought of writing something like this, particularly let it run on a device with limited resources. A simple way to refactor this would be to create an index for one of the lists and iterate through other.\n**// merge - version 2** function List\u0026lt;C\u0026gt; merge(List\u0026lt;A\u0026gt; l1, List\u0026lt;B\u0026gt; l2) {\n// create the index HashMap\u0026lt;Foo, Bar\u0026gt; map = new HashMap(); for (B b: l2) { map.put (b.foo, b); }\nfor(A a: l1) { C c = new C(a); c.add(map.get(a.foo)); } } Conventional wisdom says, that version 2 is much better than version 1. Right? Well, what if you have 128 MB of shared memory across your system, but a dedicated processor for your subsystem?! Won\u0026rsquo;t you want to pick version 1 in that case? What if both the lists can have millions of entries? That would render both these cases useless.\nSometimes, before trying to find a technical solution to the problem at hand, it might help to ask why? What is the need for this requirement? The key is to ask why until you reach a specific use-case. I tend to ask this all the way until I reach either a SOAP request, or a specific component in the GUI that requires this piece of data. Most of the time, we can get by without writing a potentially inefficient solution.\nIn this case, after several \u0026ldquo;why\u0026quot;s, I discovered that this requirement came about, since one of the products in our suite (yeah we have a bunch of products that build on each other), need to display a list of names of object C, as the user searches for a specific one to add items to. If we had decided to write either v1 or v2, every time the user opened that GUI component, we would transport, a possible 10000 records from the device all the way to the GUI (which in our case is several layers above), when we only need a list of names based on a specific criteria.\nThe \u0026ldquo;how\u0026rdquo; of your design depends the \u0026ldquo;why\u0026rdquo;. The only limiting factor is the willingness to ask why, until you can find an alternate solution, or, are absolutely convinced that there is no other way to acheive a specific requirement without writing some inefficient code \u0026mdash; then defend rigorously against doing it. well, atleast you have to get a some kind of limits in place.\nSometimes you have to stand up to your product manager, and sometimes you have to take a sip of warm wine, and go write that \u0026ldquo;piece of crap\u0026rdquo; code.\nHappy coding!\n","permalink":"http://blog.shiv.me/posts/2009/2009-02-14-the-devil-is-in-the-why/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eRecently I got asked, what the best way to do a join between two large lists,  into another list was?

For much of the last year, I have started doing things that I have abandoned in the last 8 years. The year has been quite eventful, much of it not evident from the lack of posts (which I hope to correct this year).\nAfter a frantic last-minute scramble for the visa, I managed to get to Strasbourg. I managed to escape the record-breaking snowfall in Vancouver. Strasbourg was cold, really cold, but is quite beautiful during the Christmas week.\nVisited the usual places, and added one more little town, called Riquewihr to my \u0026ldquo;places visited around Strasbourg\u0026rdquo; list. I really love the tiny towns and narrow streets in Europe. The eagerness of people to go to great lengths to maintain very old building 100s of years old is simply refreshing. Riquewihr is quite the quaint french town, and very touristy indeed. Mental Note: Need to go spend more time there, the next time.\nA week with family was so much. There is something about being with family, and not knowing the language they speak (I can\u0026rsquo;t really follow french when spoken at the \u0026ldquo;french speed\u0026rdquo;), that lets you feel at home and by yourself at the same time. It was really nice to see my aunt, uncle and cousins after a few years.\nIt has been 16 years since I held their hands as they took their first steps (I was 11 years then), but it still feels like yesterday. It was quite entertaining to let them lead me around their town! (Thanks guys I really enjoyed the places you took me to, and thanks JF for all the wine and cheese :))\nIt was an interesting experience, to see the places through eyes that are a few years older (and possibly a little wiser). The only thing I regretted was not spending more than one week there. Something that I found interesting is that as I grow older, things excite me lesser (quite obvious, I know), but somehow, I think allows me to enjoy the present more, and truly live the experience. I guess life is akin to listening to good music. The highs are not as enjoyable, when there are no lows.\n","permalink":"http://blog.shiv.me/posts/2009/2009-01-25-a-week-in-strasbourg/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAfter several no-vacation years, I ended 2008 with a (short) trip to Strasbourg, France.

Is your ISP is a cheapo-*#$% using a crappy machine for DNS, and you wait enough to count the seconds between pressing enter and the little thingy on the browser status bar says \u0026ldquo;done\u0026rdquo;? Are you subject to phishing attacks? Do you want peace of mind? Do you want auto-correction of urls? Want to block your teen from accessing \u0026ldquo;excessive\u0026rdquo; porn? Do you need a new dog to carry you paper? OpenDNS is for you (well, for the dog, you\u0026rsquo;ll have to move your ass and get one yourself). It is quite trivial to setup and really speeds up your browsing speed. You can can set it up for each computer that you use, or better still, change the configuration on your router, which would apply across all machine connected through that router.\nChanging the DNS server setting on your router, offers a few advantanges. For instance, you can define your own shortcuts for frequently used sites, and they would apply across all machines in your network. You set \u0026ldquo;mail\u0026rdquo; as a shortcut for \u0026ldquo;http://gmail.com\u0026rdquo; and every time you time \u0026ldquo;mail\u0026rdquo; in your browser\u0026rsquo;s address bar, it will be replaced with \u0026ldquo;http://gmail.com\u0026rdquo;.\nOpen DNS also auto-corrects most common spelling mistakes of popular urls. For example, if you type googel.com, it will correct it to http://google.com. It will also suggest urls when it can\u0026rsquo;t find the correct url. Certain domains can be placed in a black/white list. How cool would it be to let your 15-year old know who is boss for a change?!

Use tools to reduce your processing. (use email rules/filters to move mails to manageable folders and Google reader for feeds) Learn to skip-read. I use a 2 parse method. Parse through sets of items (email headers or blog post headlines), and mark the ones your need to pay attention to (usually around 40%). Filter based on short-listed items and then go through them in detail. In the case of blog posts, if something does retain my attention after the first 4 sentences, I skip that item. (only for blog posts) I mark the ones I have to comment on, and then do my commenting after I finish a folder.

Every guy who wants to cook decent food should have on his shelf. A simple book, with simple recipes that any idiot (aka me) can follow. Most dishes are less than 30 minutes of cooking time. I\u0026rsquo;m a very imprecise cook, and subtitute freely when I can\u0026rsquo;t find a specific fish or condiment.

Mix the curry paste, olive oil, sugar and all but 2 tbsp of the yogurt. Coat the fish with this mixture and set aside for atleast 20 minutes.\nCut the cucumber lengthwise (bâtonnet) and toss in the reserved yogurt, chopped mint and the lime juice. You want to be modest with the lime juice. Too much acidity can mask the taste of the fish.\nSear the fillets on an overproof pan\u0026ndash;setting aside the excess marinade\u0026ndash;for about 1.5 minutes on each side or until golden brown. If don\u0026rsquo;t have an overproof pan, just use any skillet and a pre-heated baking pan.\nSpoon over the marinade and place the pan in the oven and cook until done (the insides of the fish turns white and is flaky to cut).

In the last month or so, since my return from my vacation to India, I have tried eating good food, and have found cooking a very rewarding activity. It helps you think more about what you want to put in your mouth and somehow, also makes you eat less!\nI made some chicken curry last weekend, and here\u0026rsquo;s the recipe: (I didn\u0026rsquo;t have some stuff and used some substitutes instead)\n2 tbsp of Canola oil\n1/2 tsp. cloves (Didn\u0026rsquo;t have any of these :) )\n4 green or white cardamom pods (I didn\u0026rsquo;t use any though)\n2 fresh or dried bay leaves\n2 cinnamon sticks\n4 medium-size cloves of garlic, finely chopped\n2 slices of ginger (2 tsp of ginger)\n1 large tomato, cored and finely chopped.\n2 tsps of garam masala\n1 tsp of salt\n1 1/2 pounds of chicken thighs cut into 1-inch pieces\n(thighs taste better, but I used chicken breasts instead - lower in fat)\n1/2 cup of chicken broth\n4 tbps of heavy whipping cream\n2 tbps of fresh, finely chopped cilantro leaves and some tender sprigs for garnishing\n**Optional:\n**1 large onion finely chopped (I just wanted some extra flavour)\n4 hard boiled eggs (my addition, ofcourse :) )\nHere\u0026rsquo;s how you make it:\n1. Heat the oil in a medium skillet, and fry the cloves, cardamom, bay leaves and cinnamon sticks until light brown (1-2 mins)\n2. Add the onions, and fry until golden brown.\n3. Add the tomatoes, ginger, garlic, garam masala and salt. Cook until tomatoes are done, but still firm to touch. (3 to 5 mins)\n4. Stir in the chicken and the broth. Bring the curry to a boil and let it simmer until the chicken is done. (10 - 15 mins). Remember not to overcook the chicken breast, since it becomes quite rubbery and hard.\n5. Fold in the cream, and stir to blend the cream in. Make small incisions in the hard boiled eggs and add them to the curry, and roll over the sauce. Cover and allow the curry to warm up again. Be careful not to overcook after the cream, since you don\u0026rsquo;t want the fat in the cream to separate.\n6. Serve the curry with the eggs over a bed of steaming white basmati rice.\nIf you want to buy the book from Amazon.com or Amazon.ca, click below:\n","permalink":"http://blog.shiv.me/posts/2008/2008-08-04-chicken-curry-with-eggs-served-on-rice-2/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/shvelmur/2734109966/\" title=\"photo sharing\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/2734109966_379e159639.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/shvelmur/2734109966/\"\u003eChicken Curry with Eggs served on Rice\u003c/a\u003e, originally uploaded by \u003ca href=\"http://www.flickr.com/people/shvelmur/\"\u003eShivanand Velmurugan\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/shvelmur/2734113074/\" title=\"Chicken Curry with Eggs served on Rice #3 by Shivanand Velmurugan, on Flickr\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Chicken Curry with Eggs served on Rice #3\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/2734113074_e1aae30006_m.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/shvelmur/2733270027/\" title=\"Chicken Curry with Eggs served on Rice #1 by Shivanand Velmurugan, on Flickr\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Chicken Curry with Eggs served on Rice #1\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/2733270027_e97f33d54f_m.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThank you Mr. Raghavan Iyer.

I was plesantly surprised to find that the movie was playing in 2 theatres @ Silvercity, Coquitlam. With all the hype, and the huge revenue generation in the first week, the movie does deliver most of what it promises.\nBefore you start reading the rest of the post, there are few items, that could give away the plot. I wonder if one needs to worry about the plot in Batman. Here\u0026rsquo;s the short version of the review - watch it if you haven\u0026rsquo;t done so as yet. NOW!\nSome things I liked:\n1. The movie is a lot more serious than previous renderings of Batman. Finally, a Batman movie, where you don\u0026rsquo;t have to laugh at Batman.\n2. The Joker (Heath Ledger) was truly amazing. I liked that he retained the southern sounding voice. Heath shines like diamond, and really stands out in terms of his performance. It is such a pity that the world has lost such a wonderful actor. He could have been this generation\u0026rsquo;s Brando or Pacino. He has set new heights for the Batman villian (Traditionally, the villians have been better actors anyway)\n3. Batman is real, he gets hurt and has his flaws, and I don\u0026rsquo;t hear \u0026ldquo;kapow\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;zing\u0026rdquo; during the action sequences.\n4. Makeup was wonderful - both the Joker and Two-Face, are more believable and frightening in their own ways.\n5. This movie has one of the best casts in all Batman movies (For a franchise, that has always had a star cast, this one really get the right people for the roles - remember George Clooney and Arnold Schwarzenegger anyone?!)\n6. Thankfully, no robin - nuff said.\nNow for some things that could have been better\n1. 2:35 mins - the show started at 10:00 PM and ended at 1:00 AM! 3 hours is way too long (even for Indians - we get an intermission for our 3 hour movies).\n2. Two villians too big for this movie. I thought the villians didn\u0026rsquo;t get enough screen time.\n3. Two-Face\u0026rsquo;s plot is quite unconvincing, and it\u0026rsquo;s a pity he\u0026rsquo;s killed with such little damage. Aaron Eckhart is no match for Tommy Lee Jones.\n4. I hate the new Batman\u0026rsquo;s voice. What\u0026rsquo;s with the constant growling. I think that\u0026rsquo;s the only flaw with the new Batman. Christian Bale, should learn to show some emotion through his eyes (wrath, anger, hatred etc). I liked him much better in the first movie. He has shown good promise, and if he does a couple more, I can see him as one of the better Batmans. I must say, the best one (my opinion) was Michael Keaton. I always liked the quirky Batman. This more dark Batman, closer to the comic, impresses as well, but yet to prove himself. I think he needs a villian who really pushes him hard.\nAll in all, a very enjoyable 3 hours, if you have the penchant for Batman, and can hold the large Combo in your bladder long enough. Must see movie. Don\u0026rsquo;t miss it! Now, check out the trailer.

All you need, is the willingness to be read and comment on a lot of people\u0026rsquo;s content, which will enable a lot of people to follow you, which means you have their attention (one might argue the attention span is very less, but nonetheless, you have a chance).\nOnce you have a sizable following, all you need to do, is write that compelling content, that interests your followers (which should come by, as you comment more and more). Until now, to get people to visit your blog, your content has to compelling enough for them to leave the tool they used to discover your blog, and visit it, and then want to comment. Installing the worpdress plugin for friendfeed comments removes that barrier too.\nThat is exactly what I have done.

I truly do. I release a version every 3 months, and it try to make the upgrade as painless as possible. For an application like wordpress, that has been around for such a long, I would expect that they would do something to make it a little easier to upgrade.\nOk. Sorry about the rant, but here is my problem: the download for wordpress 2.5.1 is around 1 MB, but what has really changed is only a few lines. However, according to wordpress, you have to go through a time-consuming process to get your blog up to date.\nThe only reason why the wordpress team would want to do this, is coz they do not want to write an upgrade document everytime. What they really need to do, is stop bothering their blog users with such small updates and allow such updates from within wordpress itself. This is precisely the kinda thing that should by now, be atleast a plugin, if not part of the system.\nThe famous5-minute, 3-step upgrade says:\n0. Take a Backup\n0.5 Disable plugins\n1. Actually it\u0026rsquo;s three steps in this one step\nGet the latest WordPress. Either download and extract it to your computer or download it directly to the server. Delete your old wp-includes and wp-admin directories. Copy the new WordPress files to your server, overwriting old files in the root. You may use FTP or shell commands to do so. Note that this means *all* the files, including all the files in the root directory as well. If you use the default or classic theme and have customized it, then you can skip that theme. 2. Upgrade by calling the upgrade script\n3. Turn back all your plugins on.\nI grew sick of wordpress\u0026rsquo; lazy-ass upgrade steps, and decided about a year back that I would only run the upgrade their way, if it really requires taking down my website, and started doing these simple steps instead. (Ofcourse, I have a script that does this for me :) )\n1. Download wordpress to a temp dir on your server\n[shvelmur@web24 wordpress]$ curl -o wp.tar.gz http://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz % TotalÂ Â Â % Received % XferdÂ Average SpeedÂ Â TimeÂ Â Â TimeÂ Â Â Â TimeÂ Current DloadÂ UploadÂ Â TotalÂ Â SpentÂ Â Â LeftÂ Speed 100 1154kÂ Â Â 0 1154kÂ Â Â 0Â Â Â Â 0Â 5390kÂ Â Â Â Â 0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 10.8M\n2.

I finally went out and bought myself a mac. I didn\u0026rsquo;t waver. No! Not this time.Â I knew exactly what I wanted, and I was going to get it, come what may!\nI have to confess that I have been pretty critical of Apple andits policies. I still am. Nothing has changed my opinion of Apple as a company, in particular, it\u0026rsquo;s marketing team. The ipod touch price changes lead me to those conclusions.I liked the ipod touch\u0026rsquo;s interface and engineering, but when I first booted up my MacBook (Penryn-based) I was completely taken aback. The first time I booted my laptop, it was completely usable. Within a few hours, I had a few applications installed (open source ones), tweeted, seesmiced my first video, and was having fun, in general. The Mac experience was very very close to the ideal computing experience ever. (Yeah, it is that big a deal).\nIt is not just the OS, it is the bunch of applications that come with the OS, and others that you can find online, that make that initial user-experience so good. Can you duplicate this experience on a PC running windows or Linux? Of course you can, it just takes a lot of effort, and every application looks and feel different (less so in the linux world) and that is the problem.\nThe Mac presents a very cohesive user interface (different, but cohesive), that makes using the Mac a pleasure. For instance, I installed Textmate (on which I write this post). It is one of the best apps for OSX, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t waver from the basic UI guidelines of native OSX apps. That is its strength. All windows look very very similar, and the whole desktop looks a lot more integrated. There is a keyboard shortcut for pretty much every single thing. Having said all of this, there are some behavioral aspects of Mac that I think are counter-intutive.\nThe counter-intuitive Mac?!\nHere are some things that piss me off.\nYou can select text, using ctrl+shift+arrow,Â up toÂ the end orÂ beginningÂ of line, but you can\u0026rsquo;t move to end or beginning of line, using ctrl+arrow (since it is mapped to move between spaces). Hmm\u0026hellip; what will a normal user, use most?! move to beginning or end of line?! or move between work spaces?! In the notebook versions of the mac, there are no keys for pg up, pg dn, home, end. Although, these things have lost relevance in the modern day UI, there are still useful. You can use fn+arrows that do the same thing, but only when paging is involved. What else do you need them for , you ask? When I want to go to the beginning of a text field, that is highlighted, or to the end, I use the Home and End keys. That doesn\u0026rsquo;t work on all text fields. Some textboxes in safari support it and some don\u0026rsquo;tI know these are minor, but I use them everytime, I use my laptop. Why do the applications minimize when I double click on them? (I know it\u0026rsquo;s a windows thing, but I think it\u0026rsquo;s more intuitive to double click to maximize, since I want a windowsÂ maximizedÂ only when I am paying attention to it, and usually as I read through an article, I double click and continue reading. Let me assure you, that it is far more useful to maximize the window on double click than minimize it. Why? I don\u0026rsquo;t think people normally minimize windows they don\u0026rsquo;t use, they just focus the windows they use. If you want to see the desktop, you would use \u0026ldquo;show desktop\u0026rdquo;. I don\u0026rsquo;t see \u0026ldquo;Minimize\u0026rdquo; needed that often as maximize. Also, in OS X, maximize = fit window to content. hmm.. that works for the web apps, but not so much for native apps. In any case, there ought to be some way to force an app to fill the screen. (No! Manually dragging an image to fit a 24\u0026quot; screen is not fun, and why I do that?! One word - Lightroom) I know I will get used to the quirks, but they still are exactly that - quirks that are forced on the user (like any other OS out there - to be fair).\n","permalink":"http://blog.shiv.me/posts/2008/2008-03-15-biting-the-mac-bullet/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI did it!

I am sick and tired of hearing story after story of crazed authority figures, forcing rules upon the common man, rendering life to a boring, monotonous series of security checks and bans and fines. From security at airports, to self-righteous moderation aimed at photographers in public spaces. I am sick of it.\nThere are a few like Thomas Hawk, who continue to risk holding on to their principles in public, at the risk of crazed comments and flak from an audience that could care less. An example, is his post today.\nWhen I\u0026rsquo;m on an airplane, and the flight attendant tells everyone to turn off their cell phones and personal electronics, I never turn my iPhone off. I just leave it on. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure why I don\u0026rsquo;t turn it of\nWhy should anyone turn off cellphones? or any electronic equipment for that matter?! every time I get on a plane, all I hear is that, cellphones could cause disruption of air-traffic communication and therefore everyone (usually 500 or more) have to turn off all electrical and electronic appliances.\nThere are several flaws with this rule.\nRelying on voice based communication systems that are frail enough to be disrupted by a few cell phones are not safe enough for critical information. Pilots and Air-traffic control, should switch to more reliable data transfer mechanisms. I am allowed to use my computer and other electronic devices post lift-off but not during it! Is losing communication in the middle of the flight somehow safer that losing it during lift-off? This \u0026ldquo;rule\u0026rdquo; is symptomatic of several rules that we have in modern society: rules that have stopped making sense, but we continue to follow and enforce them senselessly\nTurn cellphones off near petrol stations. No flash in museums or photo galleries (In Canada), if you are the first car at an intersection turning left, and you have a green, move to the middle of the road until you find a space in the on coming traffic. (clear recipe for disaster) Taking off shoe, toothpaste, comb, hair gel etc and displaying it to the world a.k.a your co-travelers, whilst wondering where all the stuff that they collect goes?! Several things caught my eye, as I re-searched after I read Thomas\u0026rsquo; post.\nCheck out this note posted on FCC\u0026rsquo;s website.\nIn March 2007, the FCC terminated a proceeding that it began in late 2004 to consider potentially lifting this ban. The FCC determined that the technical information provided by interested parties in response to the proposal was insufficient to determine whether in-flight use of wireless devices on aircraft could cause harmful interference to wireless networks on the ground. Therefore, it decided at this time to make no changes in the rules prohibiting in-flight use of such devices.\nEssentially, as opposed to proving something is not safe (or safe), the FCC decides to maintain status quo?!\nWikipedia article on the Channel reuse :\nChannel reuse works because from a mobile phone on the ground, there will only be one \u0026ldquo;closest\u0026rdquo; tower that can possibly use a particular group of frequencies, CDMA codes, or time slots. The software that manages the system assumes that the signal from a phone on a particular tower can, on other towers, only be \u0026ldquo;heard\u0026rdquo; at greatly reduced signal strength. The frequency, code, or time slot used by the phone can therefore be reused by other phones on other towers.\n\u0026hellip; and goes on to say \u0026hellip;\nIf a mobile phone is operated from an aircraft in flight above a city, this assumption is no longer valid, because the towers of many different cells may be about equidistant from the phone. Multiple towers might assume that the phone is under their control. The phone could be assigned a free channel by one tower, but could be heard on other towers using the same channel group, and the channel might already be in use on those towers. This could cause interference with existing calls. It is possible that the software controlling the towers could crash. Even if the software can cope with hearing the same phone on multiple, non-adjacent towers, the result at best is an overall decrease in the system\u0026rsquo;s capacity.\nAn additional concern is the output power of the mobile handset. Because the towers might be many miles below the aircraft, the phone might have to transmit at its maximum power to be received. This will increase the risk of interference with electronic equipment on the aircraft.\nSo essentially, the main reason for not allowing is that it could crash cell towers?! (The Wikipedia article provides more instances where there have been next to no evidence of mobile phones impacting air-traffic communication). Now I get why, it has to be switched off just before take-off, and not before entering the plane. Hmmm\u0026hellip; sounds like this regulation is more in the interest of cost control, that safety. The issue I have with legislation like this, is that, I would be happy to comply, if I was told that the true reason.\nIn the post-9/11 era, we have become more tolerant to crappy policy-making, and this is true all over the world. The \u0026ldquo;Bush infection\u0026rdquo; and the politics of fear (thanks Obama for bringing that up), has spread way beyond just the US. Every single country has had to suffer repercussions of the fear-tactics, and millions of air-travelers have to suffer for the benefit of the few.\nAnd, this .. this..\n\u0026ldquo;This is it! It\u0026rsquo;s the final straw. We need to do something about it!\u0026rdquo;\nNote: where did the phrase \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s the final straw\u0026rdquo; originate. Some answers - here and here.\nUpdate: Check out this picture of a Virgin Atlantic Wifi based food ordering system inside a plane.

Thankfully, we are way ahead of what someone a hundred years ago could imagine, how we would heat ourselves.\nNo mosquitoes or flies\nNot much of a change there (although, if you are reading this, then you probably live in a place will lesser mosquitoes than 100 years back)\nOne thing, I bet he never, in his wildest dreams, would have conceived was that we will have patents for mosquito repellents\nReady-cooked meals\nWe have found a million ways to feed ourselves, and this includes fast-food, and packaged dinners and Martha Stewart\u0026rsquo;s.

Woot! Google, good for ye. You are trying to do what someone thought of 100 years back. Go tidal power.\nThere will be no street cars in our large cities\nYeah right.\nPhotographs will be telegraphed\n2 cheers here. We even went a step further and invented this thingy called the internet, and we actually have quite a few sites (about 100,000)Â out there helping us do this. (big business these days uh?)\nTrains @ 150 miles/hour\nSadly, the US has moved away from trains and on to air-traffic in the last 100 years. The fastest train as of 1999 - the Metroliner reaches a maximum commercial speed of 125 mph (slower by 25 mph, dang!). But, there are several fast trains out there, that go over 300 mph.\nAutomobiles will be cheaper than horses\nNo comment. (I am trying to negotiate a deal with a local honda dealer - P.s: You guys areÂ great!)\nEverybody will walk ten miles\nIt feels like it without a car.\nTo England in two days\nI found a very interesting site, that talks about planes, fuel efficiency and flight times between New York and London.\nFight Time is the time taken by different aircrafts to fly between New York and London. Interesting to see that only two of the above are currently operational -Â the Boeing 747 and the F-15 Eagle. With the other two retired, a human being will have to sit for over 7 hours in a sealed coffin to reach London.\nThere will be air-ships\nSee above picture or google \u0026ldquo;aircraft\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;planes\u0026rdquo;. (no link for you, lazy bum)\nAerial War ships and forts on wheels\nWe have the most unimaginative names for them, planes and tanks?! How cool is \u0026ldquo;forts on wheels\u0026rdquo;?!\nThere will be no wild animals\nWell, we are almost there. I guess in another 20 to 30 years we will surely achieve this goal/vision. (Do ya see me smiling at this one?!)\nMan will see around the world\nHe was talking about google\u0026rsquo;s sight-seeing man!\nTelephones around the world\nGrand opera will be telephoned\nHow children will be taught\nThe will not be taught. They will be hypnotized into zombies, roaming around the world pursuing pointless objectives. That\u0026rsquo;s what 100 years can do to the human race (I\u0026rsquo;m feeling itchy today)\nStore purchases by tubes\nVegetables grown by electricity\nOranges will grow in Philadelphia\nStrawberries as large as apples\nPeas as large as beets\nBlack, Blue and Green Roses\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s with the predictions about food and flowers?! We have delegated these activities to the faceless farmer. (I haven\u0026rsquo;t seen one in years). For all I know, the food that I eat is being grown in mars, and arrives on my table through a disruption in the sub-space continuum.\nFew drugs will be swallowed\nNada on this one. Sorry. We have invented so many more drugs that we humans continue to swallow pills at an incredible pace. We even have new patents on pill swallowing.\n","permalink":"http://blog.shiv.me/posts/2007/2007-11-30-what-will-happen-in-100-years/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThat is a very difficult question to answer (which I don\u0026rsquo;t answer anywhere in this post: go away).

A week passed and with no sign of a confirmation of account activation, I called their call center.\nCall 1:\nCustomer care executive(CCE): Good morning, ICICI bank, how may I help you?\nMe: Hi, I\u0026rsquo;m Shivanand and I opened an account with you last week.

I find that absurd, and downright stupid. I am trying to give you business and the first experience I get is inability to tell me why you\u0026rsquo;ve taken my money, but not activated my account?! If such is the level of incompetence, how well can you take care of my money?!!\nWell, being fed up with call centers, I decided to call the branch itself. I called in, using the branch\u0026rsquo;s number, and someone at the branch picked it up. She got my Cust ID, and my phone number, and said, she will call me in half hour. End of call and I am actually happy that I got the thing moving! That was simple, wasn\u0026rsquo;t it? I spent 2 minutes, and got more confidence than a 20 minute conversation with a call center employee, who just doesn\u0026rsquo;t care enough about the customer.\nI also sent, this mail to ICICI customer care.\nHi,\nI recently opened an account with ICICI bank Canada (I have been a ICICI bank customer for the last 6 years in India) and have not received confirmation of account activation. I tried calling your call center and was faced with a shouting employee. I found like to refrain from mentioning the person by name. Please educate your call center employees, that as a customer, I have not interest in the limitations that you have in your back office.\nI gave the employee my First name, last name and my customer identification number, and all he could give me was that my account was not active. (which is why I was calling). Also, remember this is after ICICI bank had withdrawn $5000 from my account (I gave a cheque for the initial deposit) a week back. I think it would be best if you can sensitize your employees on the ethics of phone conversation and also try and provide a solution rather than try and get rid of the call.\nI usually make it public, when I rant about something and have posted this mail on my blog.

Tiny code is always best. Now you must carry water up the hill for the rest of the day.\nFor sure, he can\u0026rsquo;t think up of good stories. Just Kidding! Every time we, developers, make a change or fix a bug, we decide the fate of that particular code flow. We take a call on how the module or component is going to behave for the rest of the life of that application.\nWhile I agree that writing reams of code for something expressed much more simply, is evil, is it really the amount of code that you put in a file/class/function that influences the manageability of code. I personally am convinced that number of conditional branching clauses (more simply put if..then..else) that you use is evil(er). The lesser if..then clauses you have in your code, the lesser bugs you will produce.\nHe then, goes on about something that is totally a different beast. Abstraction in the name of flexibility:\nWhen most people learn objective languages, the first thing they do is go ape. I mean, they create superclasses that have one method, which is stubbed out, and twenty children classes, each of which varies by one line of code. They fall so in love with objects that they think everything needs to be its OWN TYPE of object.\nOften this is done in the name of flexibility. \u0026ldquo;Look, I have this abstract superclass which currently does the drawing for all my buttons, but you could subclass it to, say, draw 3D text!\u0026rdquo;\nThis is something, that I just couldn\u0026rsquo;t believe is a real problem. Why? Well, I have, in my last 6+ years of development in both, service and product companies, never ever had to stay awake because of too much abstraction.\nMost of the time, I find the converse is true. Apparently anyone (who write code for money: (Ohh.. by the way, the word apparently is a very convenient word, it lets me state something, without having to really prove it with some hard facts :) - I learned this from Douglas - we miss ye)), seems uninterested in abstracting code, care less for code re-use.\nLet us just step back and think, why do most people want to be **this evil! **Human tendency is to achieve a goal, with the least amount of effort possible. (I can bet my head on this: Say we find someway to automate the ability to ingest food, and excrete it, most will gladly adopt it! )\nWell, it is always much easier to write a function yourself, to achieve that day\u0026rsquo;s goal to fix X number of bugs or getting a feature Y done and commit the code, than to go hunting for abstractions and re-factor already tested code.\nTrust me, Rich, I have **never ever **found an unwanted abstraction, or even class hierarchies that run more than a few classes deep. Do I wish, what you were stating is true in the industry? I most truly will be the happiest application programmer, if my library developers actually remembered that they develop libraries, and if my colleagues remembered that someday, they will have to fix bugs in their own code, because of the million functional flows they created and the lack of any code reuse that they have ensured.\nHowever, one thing that I really subscribe to is:\nDon\u0026rsquo;t make your code more flexible until after you have a plan for what your app.\nI would like to add one more clause of wisdom to that:\n\u0026ldquo;Re-factor you code, at every single opportunity you get, even if it means that you need to bite your manager\u0026rsquo;s head off!\u0026rdquo;\nIf you did read upto here, then I must say : boy you need to get a life!!

Well, one thing is easy with web-apps and that is collaboration. You want to share your documents with a couple of friends, or maybe be your class, then it usually takes just a click, and you can share it with the world if you please and get it indexed on a search engine in a shorter time.

With quite a few hours of flying time, and long waits at airport lounges, I got the chance to catch up on my reading. Went through two books this time around, the placid, but mildly interesting \u0026ldquo;The Namesake\u0026rdquo; by Jhumpa Lahiri (skip the book and watch the movie.. way better) and the exhilariting final masterpiece, \u0026ldquo;The Salmon of Doubt\u0026rdquo;, (wikipedia entry here) by the new age, space comic, Douglas Adams.\nThe Salmon, is a collection of various bits of Douglas\u0026rsquo; writing, and it reveals the quirky, and funny guy that he was. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t resist putting this anecdote online (although it might be breaching some copyright - so please don\u0026rsquo;t copy it any further and if someone wants to take this down, just drop me a comment)\nHow to brew Tea - Douglas Adams\nGo to Marks and Spencer and by a packet of Earl Grey tea. Go back to where you are staying and boil a kettle of water. While it is coming to boil, open the sealed packet and sniff. Careful - you may feel a bit dizzy, but this is in fact perfectly legal. When the kettle has boiled, pour a little of it into a teapot, swirl it around , and tip it out again. Put a couple (or three, depending on the size of the pot) of tea bags into the pot. (If I was really trying to lead you into the paths of righteousness, I would tell you to use free leaves rather than bags, but let\u0026rsquo;s take this in easy stages.) Bring the kettle back upto a boil, and then pour the boiling water as quickly as you can into the pot. Let it stand for two or three minutes, and then pour it into a cup.

After umpteen calls to sify call center, I decided to send mails to the CEO,CTO and Communications Officer of Sifycorp, to let them know of the pathetic state of affairs, and horrible experience of being a sify broadband user. I have attached a snapshot of the mail that I sent to them.\nHere is the content of the mail in totem.\nHi Ranjith,\nFirstly, my id with satyam broadband is SHVELMUR\nI own a sify broadband connection for over the last one year.\nI have spent more time contacting your technical staff than using your Internet connection in the last few months. Today, I had to sign in through your connection to attend a conference call (work related). I was unable to do so since my account was inactivated. So I called up your customer service 3 times (that\u0026rsquo;s how many time you need to try to give you some business)and finally got hold of a customer executive, who took a request for renewal.I was initially impressed that only 3 calls were required to get some work done.\nI was proved to be wrong. Five minutes after I started using your connection, in the midst of a chat with my customer, I lost connectivity. Not to be discouraged, I attempted calling your dreaded call center for a resolution. In 3 more tries, I got through to your customer care executive, and explained my urgency, raised a ticket and asked for a quick resolution or the phone number of the local operator in charge of my connection. Apparently, the information is not available to your agents, and hence was denied the phone number.\nI waited for 2 hours, and called again, to get some status on the ticket and had a skill set abort. (your agent essentially cut the call on me)\nI called yet again, in about 20 mins time, and got in touch with Ms Latha, who provided me with your mail address.\nAfter multiple interaction with your company in the last year, I\u0026rsquo;m completely disillusioned with your service, and hence I\u0026rsquo;m copying the CEO, the CTO, and the HR Head, hoping that they would be to some extent concerned about the pathetic situation at your enterprise.\nBy any chance if you want to reach me, you can respond using the following:\nweb link : I posted this mail here.\nphone: 0413 2243583\nweekend mobile: +91 9894545527\nweekday mobile: +91 9901066344\nIf you can resolve/provide my with some status/the phone number of the local service provider (in my area - Pondicherry). Please send me the details.\nregs\nShivanand Software Consultant\nNovell Software Development Ltd.\nwebsite: http://shvelmur.com\nMark Twain - \u0026ldquo;Do the right thing. It will gratify some people and astonish the rest.\u0026rdquo;\nI will keep you posted as to how responsive (or not) the sify guys are. Let us see if we can drive some efficiency and responsibility into our so-called giants of Indian IT.\nUpdate: I guess to get prompt service, we need to raise a hullaboo and send mails to CEO, CTO and CCOs of the company. Well, atleast they did respond and I got a call within 10 minutes of the mail asking if my connection works. After about 30 minutes, they got it working. Good work, but next time, please do it before I send mails to your mom. :)\n[tags]rants. sify, broadband in india[/tags]\n","permalink":"http://blog.shiv.me/posts/2007/2007-02-24-hell-via-sify-broadband/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://shvelmur.com/images/wpress/HellviaSifyBroadband_CA0A/sifymail10.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/sifymail_thumb8.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had a hell of a time connecting using sify \u0026ldquo;narrow\u0026quot;band connection.

You can find the link to the original article here.\nI post the whole content here, well coz I like my content in my own space! Now there is a feature that no web 2.0 application allows. Why can\u0026rsquo;t content reside separate from the service? Every application from gmail to backpackit, want you to trust them with your content. I think that should change, mebbe we shoul called that web 2.5?\n\u0026ldquo;What can people do with the web?\nWhy did this ubiquous concept of sharing information for free (and paid) catch so rapidly, that is is now considered the next greatest thing since sliced bread? What makes it so very exciting for millions across the world to share the small section of expertise that they possess with the rest of the world?\nI have had the good fortune, to have been exposed to the web in its very early days (1994-1995). Back then, if you had the chance to browse a website, you were considered super-cool and you would be the talk of the school (yup, I was in high school at that time) for a whole month! You finally were considered a super-geek, who KNEW the NET! Pretty interesting when you consider that these days you have scores of 6th grade kids that scream, HTML and Javascript in their sleeps (I actually happen to know at least 2 13 year olds who do that!).\nHumble beginings\nWe would use this hyper-cool browser called Lynx. You will have to manually establish a ppp connection to your local ISPs gateway (whose root password was usually set to root or root123 or thereabouts) using hyperterminal and then you would need use unix programs to access your mail, browse the net and that was about all you could do (once you discovered root access it was a different ball-game altogether though â€\u0026rdquo; think VPNsâ€¦ meaning to say we ran our own ISPs! ). Security was of no concern since most of the hardware failed to provide connectivity forget security. Anyway a modem would cost around Rs 4000 (I usually got Rs 50 a month as pocket money â€\u0026quot; I would save 50% of that ) so no one was really connecting in and exploiting the gateway!\nWhat made the web exciting then, was the ability to check out, what was there on some machine somewhere â€\u0026quot; the ability to access information from sources (mostly universities) that were located far beyond the realm of a 15 year old kidâ€(tm)s imagination. The excitement of finding a small exploit or a getting access to some cutting edge research material was enough to keep us making endless tries to get a stable connection and our eyes glued to our text-based browsers.\nWeb 1.0\nThen, it was the rise of Netscape that redefined the NET as we knew it. Suddenly we could see images, we could hear music (mostly MIDI - that idea never struck on much), we could chat with people across the globe, could make friends from the farthest reaches of the human race. At one point of time, I had close to 200 people on my chat list on Yahoo Messenger, from London to Vladivastock, from Sydney to â€œsome cityâ€ in Greenland.\nThe age of Netscape brought the entire human race closer together, people from different countries could interact without the physical presence. The concept of community thinking and collective thought gave the web an entirely new meaning. It slowly brought about the change in the way we work, we kept in touch with relatives in distant lands, it replaced the postal service for most uses, it brought down the call charges as VOIP slowly crept it. Such point of inflection usually generate a flurry of activity in the development community, which invariably leads to innovation and new technologies coming to production.\nWeb 2.0\nToday, we are at such an inflection point. What is different this time around is that this change in the way of the web, is caused by huge commercial demand placed on the set of 10-year-old Web 1.0 technologies. The internet has entered our lives and entwined itself in such in-seperable ways into the fabric of human interaction that the users of the NET are now demanding more and more from the NET. It has moved from being a medium to keep a bunch of college professors in sync with each other, to a mammoth â€œwebâ€ that spans the globe and touches our lives in every which way possible.\nSo what are we talking about here? We talking shared computing. There will be a day, not very much in the future, when we will hire processing power, we will hire application services for those needs that we buy a computer and pay loads of licensing cost in the form of software fees.\nWeb 2.0 will place more importance of generation of content, distributing it to the destination, without having the need to spend too much effort on the user (No buying this software or that, maybe even, no buying any hardware at all). It is about collaborative working. Any task, can now be worked upon by any number of people, in any number of geographies. We are going beyond the realms of our physical-selves.\nThe past one year has seen the revival and slow maturation of a 10 year old technology that was part of HTTP 1.0. By now, if you have been doing any form of web programming you would have heard about AJAX and AHAH. Although the names given to these concept of web-programming are relatively new, the technology that is used here have been available since Web1.0 days.\nSo what is the novelty? What is the â€œnewâ€ thing?\nThe novelty is that the NET as we know it is ready for change, ready to take the next step in getting the human race closer, helping it communicate and collaborate better. A lot of tools have already emerged in the real world. Applications that are currently free services, but offer extremely interesting opportunities for revenue generation. The service that I am using to write this article for instance is a Web 2.0 based online document editor. Check out more such tools below\nWritely (bought by Google) Netvibes Gmail Google Suggest Flickr (bought by Yahoo) BackPackIt In summary, the last 2 to 3 years has taken the web from a static collection of web pages, to a dynamic data processing environment, to which human life is irrevocably intertwined, bring itself closer. Human interaction has left the physical limits of our bodies and expression of thought has taken a whole new meaning.

I found that I needed to setup cygwin if I need to build it, and another 100 MB download is not what I wanted to be doing.\nSo I pulled Sharpdevelop 2.1.0, (monodevelop was apparently forked from sharpdevelop), off here, and I installed it. As per the instructions found here, I tried to compile the application, but SharpDevelop, threw a twister at me. It said \u0026ldquo;mono is not installed\u0026rdquo;. I tried hunting around for some options somewhere that told SharpDevelop where to look for mono, but was able to find no help.\nWell, I did get it fixed. All I had to do was re-run mono install.\nAparently, the order of installation of the IDE and mono is:\n1. Install the IDE\n2. Install mono\nI always thought that it had to be the other way around.

Then, the next time around you can eliminate that way and go on to more efficient ways. On that note, if you don\u0026rsquo;t want to do all the editing yourself. You can find the files here. Just download them and put them in you wp-admin directory, and enjoy! Ofcourse, you better take all the backups required and don\u0026rsquo;t spam me if something is screwed up in your database.\nbatch-categories.php menu.php Note: 1. Do not use left-click on the above link. Use right-click and \u0026ldquo;Save Link As..\u0026rdquo;/\u0026ldquo;Save Target As..\u0026rdquo; and rename the file to *.php instead of *.php.txt\n2. The above files are valid for 1.5.1 Wordpress only. Please follow the manual procedure for later versions\nWishlist for batch categories(BC)\nSince we are discussing BC here, I thought I\u0026rsquo;ll jot down a couple things that would make BC really kewl\nDisplay categories already assigned Instead of a combo, use a multiple listbox report category names instead of IDs UI for options like number of posts,etc Paging - displays all posts, but on different pages.
