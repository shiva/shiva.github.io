    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2011/08/dump-fb-for-gplus">10 reasons to dump Facebook for G+. Now!</a></h1>

    <div id="post">
      <p>A friend asked what I like about google+, and as I started posting a reply , I noticed there were enough to make a blog post. So here goes...</p>
<p>Here's a quick list:<br />
1. Mobile app on android and iphone are awesome!<br />
2. Automatic upload of pics on phone/picasa<br />
3. Non-crappy photos (allows 2400+px, and g+ renders pictures better, since they don't mess with the image, if it is smaller than the max size)<br />
4. Easier to mention specific people in a conversation. (auto-completes ppl's profile name)<br />
5. hangouts (free video conferencing)<br />
6. Group messaging done right (huddle) on the mobile phone<br />
7. decent integration with email (I guess this is just coz I use Gmail)<br />
8. Privacy - predictable and manageable (not that it matters to me)<br />
9. Much less noise (a - mostly used by techies for now, b - allows asymmetric relationships à la twitter)<br />
10. Keyboard shortcuts (J, K work. Someone at google like vi  -- a lot)</p>
<p>So, there's 10 reasons to dump Facebook for G+. There is a lot more in terms of features (new ones are added all the time), but mostly the community is awesome, and the engagement is better!</p>
<p>11. (bonus). I was going to say games, but they have that here too, but I'm not bothered by it, and don't have to see someone's update on buying sheep</p>
<p>Having said the above, I miss a couple of FB "features". Really, its the of the same: 1. There is no way to start a conversation with someone, unless, you address it specifically to that person (in which case nobody else see it). Facebook does this simply, by providing a "wall". </p>
<p>2. There are no "Groups". Ie each circle is local to me, and hence, if I want to have a group for all my friends from university, I will have to add them to a circle. In order to simulate Facebook "groups", everyone in that circle, has to add everyone else to a group of the same name. Adding one more person to that group, now means that everyone has to add that person manually.</p>
<p>I'm sure, google will come up with something to address the above two. We'll have to wait and see how it goes!</p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2011/07/people-of-gvrd">People of GVRD - a photographic experiment</a></h1>

    <div id="post">
      <p>A couple of weeks ago I started a new project - to shoot random strangers in the streets of GVRD (Greater Vancouver Regional Districts - for those of you that are not from here). I wanted to see if I had the guts to walk up to random strangers, and ask their permission to shoot a picture of them. I was also curious to know how they would react to it, and what my success rate would be.</p>
<p>I've asked around 14, and 8 said yes. Some of them were not comfortable with their pictures on the internets. I offered them 3 options.</p>
<ol>
<li>Pictures don't end up on the internet (emailed to them if they send me an email)</li>
<li>On the internet for non-commercial purposes.</li>
<li>On the internet in public domain.</li>
</ol>
<p>Only 2 were ok with public domain. The rest opted for option 2. One didn't want it on the internet at all.</p>
<p>It was an interesting experience, and I'm looking forward to more such excursions. For the lack of a better name, I chose to call this project : <a href="http://blog.shiv.me/projects/people-of-gvrd/">People of GVRD</a>.</p>
<p>Suggestions are welcome. Do you have a better name for the project? Perhaps, thoughts on how I should approach people. Do you think I'm insane? Apart from photos, would you be interested in a short blurb about the person? What would you like to know?</p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2011/07/osx-lion-a-first-look-at-2-am">OSX Lion. A first look (at 2 AM)</a></h1>

    <div id="post">
      <p>Just upgraded to OSX Lion. A very slick interface.</p>
<p>Quick Review:</p>
<p>1. Launchpad. Solved previously by Alfred in the GUI, and bash aliases on the command line.</p>
<p>2. Mission Control. Eye-candy. Will probably use it until I get tired of all the moving windows, and stick to Cmd+arrow keys to switch desktops. Maybe normal users will find it useful. But then, most people don't want anything that increases their workflow complexity. Most of them have trouble keeping track of more than a couple of windows, let alone, 10s of them (which I think is what features like Mission Control will promote)</p>
<p>3. I'll probably never use gestures (keyboard shortcuts solved that probably elegantly, some 40 years ago).</p>
<p>4. First real annoyance: the default mouse-axis configuration is inverted. I don't get why this was changed?! (refer image)</p>
<p>It's way too late to go into other cool and annoying things. I'm not sure how I really feel about Lauchpad. Maybe it's not a bad idea to have a full screen view of all the apps - ipad style.</p>
<p>P.S: Until I figure out how to get all of my posts on Google+ as full content, I'm going to double post them.</p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2011/06/exporting-xdisplay">Exporting XDisplay</a></h1>

    <div id="post">
      <p>In *nix systems, you can make the display, the GUI of an application, appear on another machine.  This if often required, when the machine you want to run the application on is in a lab, and you have access through a desktop machine that has a monitor.</p>
<p>You can do this, by running an XServer on the desktop machine and configuring the client (the one where you run your app) with the XServer details. By default, the XServer instance on your desktop disallows communication from all machines except localhost. Thus, you will need to add the host in the allowed list using the xhost command.</p>
<p><strong>On your machine</strong>,  to disable security checks:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><code>$ xhost +</code></p>
<p>To allow connections from a single  host:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><code>$ xhost +&lt;hostname/ip&gt;</code></p>
<p><strong>On the client machine</strong> where the application is run, set the X Server to display to (for bash shell):</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><code>$ export DISPLAY=&lt;hostname&gt;:&lt;displaynumber&gt;.&lt;screennumber&gt;</code></p>
<p>If you haven't changed the display-number or screen-number :</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><code>$ export DISPLAY=&lt;hostname&gt;:0.0</code></p>
