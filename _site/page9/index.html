    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2011/07/people-of-gvrd">People of GVRD - a photographic experiment</a></h1>

    <div id="post">
      <p>A couple of weeks ago I started a new project - to shoot random strangers in the streets of GVRD (Greater Vancouver Regional Districts - for those of you that are not from here). I wanted to see if I had the guts to walk up to random strangers, and ask their permission to shoot a picture of them. I was also curious to know how they would react to it, and what my success rate would be.</p>
<p>I've asked around 14, and 8 said yes. Some of them were not comfortable with their pictures on the internets. I offered them 3 options.</p>
<ol>
<li>Pictures don't end up on the internet (emailed to them if they send me an email)</li>
<li>On the internet for non-commercial purposes.</li>
<li>On the internet in public domain.</li>
</ol>
<p>Only 2 were ok with public domain. The rest opted for option 2. One didn't want it on the internet at all.</p>
<p>It was an interesting experience, and I'm looking forward to more such excursions. For the lack of a better name, I chose to call this project : <a href="http://blog.shiv.me/projects/people-of-gvrd/">People of GVRD</a>.</p>
<p>Suggestions are welcome. Do you have a better name for the project? Perhaps, thoughts on how I should approach people. Do you think I'm insane? Apart from photos, would you be interested in a short blurb about the person? What would you like to know?</p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2011/07/osx-lion-a-first-look-at-2-am">OSX Lion. A first look (at 2 AM)</a></h1>

    <div id="post">
      <p>Just upgraded to OSX Lion. A very slick interface.</p>
<p>Quick Review:</p>
<p>1. Launchpad. Solved previously by Alfred in the GUI, and bash aliases on the command line.</p>
<p>2. Mission Control. Eye-candy. Will probably use it until I get tired of all the moving windows, and stick to Cmd+arrow keys to switch desktops. Maybe normal users will find it useful. But then, most people don't want anything that increases their workflow complexity. Most of them have trouble keeping track of more than a couple of windows, let alone, 10s of them (which I think is what features like Mission Control will promote)</p>
<p>3. I'll probably never use gestures (keyboard shortcuts solved that probably elegantly, some 40 years ago).</p>
<p>4. First real annoyance: the default mouse-axis configuration is inverted. I don't get why this was changed?! (refer image)</p>
<p>It's way too late to go into other cool and annoying things. I'm not sure how I really feel about Lauchpad. Maybe it's not a bad idea to have a full screen view of all the apps - ipad style.</p>
<p>P.S: Until I figure out how to get all of my posts on Google+ as full content, I'm going to double post them.</p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2011/06/exporting-xdisplay">Exporting XDisplay</a></h1>

    <div id="post">
      <p>In *nix systems, you can make the display, the GUI of an application, appear on another machine.  This if often required, when the machine you want to run the application on is in a lab, and you have access through a desktop machine that has a monitor.</p>
<p>You can do this, by running an XServer on the desktop machine and configuring the client (the one where you run your app) with the XServer details. By default, the XServer instance on your desktop disallows communication from all machines except localhost. Thus, you will need to add the host in the allowed list using the xhost command.</p>
<p><strong>On your machine</strong>,  to disable security checks:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><code>$ xhost +</code></p>
<p>To allow connections from a single  host:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><code>$ xhost +&lt;hostname/ip&gt;</code></p>
<p><strong>On the client machine</strong> where the application is run, set the X Server to display to (for bash shell):</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><code>$ export DISPLAY=&lt;hostname&gt;:&lt;displaynumber&gt;.&lt;screennumber&gt;</code></p>
<p>If you haven't changed the display-number or screen-number :</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><code>$ export DISPLAY=&lt;hostname&gt;:0.0</code></p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2011/05/ipad-and-friends">iPad and friends</a></h1>

    <div id="post">
      <p><a href="http://blog.shiv.me/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/20110501-112322.jpg"><img src="/images/20110501-112322.jpg" alt="20110501-112322.jpg" class="alignnone size-full" /></a></p>
<p>It's been a year since I <a href="http://blog.shiv.me/2010/05/29/icaved.html">sold my kidneys for an iPad</a>. It's been fun. It has replaced every other device I own (ie, a couple of PCs and the nexus one). It's an outright winner, when it comes to reading, especially long-form articles, and books alike. It has become my go-to machine for everyday news, twitter/facebook, and even for browsing my favorite photographers.</p>
<p>It have however remained strictly in the realm of content consumption -- until now. In the last few days, I've added a stylus - the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ZSHKIY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=shivanand-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399349&creativeASIN=B003ZSHKIY">Targus iPad stylus</a> (available quite readily at most 'best-buy's, and on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ZSHKIY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=shivanand-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399349&creativeASIN=B003ZSHKIY">Amazon</a>), and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003K1EYM6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=keepinintouch-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399353&creativeASIN=B003K1EYM6">iPad's camera connect kit</a>. If you own an iPad (v1 or v2) I would recommend that you fork out the moolah for these two. It will be the best $50 you'll ever spend on accessories for the iPad. Forget the cool looking <a href="http://store.apple.com/us/product/MC942?mco=MTM3NjE5ODE">smart cover</a>. These will be more rewarding than the 2 hours of thrill of watching the smart cover turn off the ipad when you close it.</p>
<p>The targus stylus is without doubt the best one in the market yet. It's got good heft to it. Feels comfortable to hold. The only gripe I have with the Targus is the length. I can't but wonder why they didn't make it same as a standard pencil. </p>
<p>There is no contest between this, and the <a href="http://tenonedesign.com/sketch.php">Pogo Sketch</a>. (Ten-one design could be the next Wacom, if they get their <a href="http://thetechjournal.com/electronics/tablet/pressure-sensitive-drawing-headed-to-ipad.xhtml"></a><a href="http://thetechjournal.com/electronics/tablet/pressure-sensitive-drawing-headed-to-ipad.xhtml">pressure sensitive stylus</a> right. Wacom should buy them out, now, before they get too big). The targus has an air-filled bubble for the tip, which slides with less resistance against the iPad's screen, than the spongy one of the pogo sketch. The tip is still fairly large, and the level of control you get varies by the app. If you use <a href="itms-apps://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/penultimate/id354098826?mt=8"></a><a href="itms-apps://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/penultimate/id354098826?mt=8">Penultimate</a>, this stylus will provide much better control. The iPad can now actually replace paper & pen (somewhat). I can't wait to see how good the <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2011/04/wacom-stylus-for-ipad-is-not-what-youre-hoping-for/">Wacom</a> <a href="http://www.geeky-gadgets.com/wacom-ipad-stylus-looks-ugly-but-works-beautiful-18-04-2011/">stylus</a> <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-31747_7-20055024-243.html">is going to be</a>. It will definitely cost more (around $40 if I'm right), but for $20, this is the best stylus (that is also readily available) right now. </p>
<p>The camera connect kit, is a thing of marvel. It is not like Apple to allow such a wide range of applications for a single piece of plastic (even if it is over-priced for something that should be part of the iPad purchase). I just found out that it works quite well with my camera (a Canon 7D). Importing RAW images onto the iPad are faster than importing them on my MacbookPro (something seriously out-of-whack here -- I'll need to investigate, to confirm this). It also allows connecting any "Mac" supported keyboard (I'm typing this post on my logitech USB Wave keyboard, which I must say kicks the pants off any keyboard Apple currently sells). Of course, carrying a keyboard around is out of question, but it's nice to know it works without any special drivers.</p>
<p><strong>Tip</strong>: Both <em>Ctrl+shift+arrows</em> (begin/end of line), and <em>Cmd+shift+arrows</em> (1-word at a time) allow you to select text on iPad. of course, you can navigate around the text, if you don't use shift. No, someone needs to port vim to iOS. That would be awesome.</p>
<p>The killer combo of the week, was a little hard to choose. Here are two:</p>
<ul>
<li>Targus Stylus + Penultimate</li>
<li>Blogsy + iPad Camera connect kit + Logitech Wave keyboard</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://blog.photosmithapp.com/"></a><a href="http://blog.photosmithapp.com/">Photosmith</a> looks like a promising app. Currently, it is metadata management and import app, that syncs with Lightroom via Wifi. $20 is quite reasonable for an app that will allow automatic import into lightroom. However, I'm unconvinced with the design. I wish they would provide better selection capabilities. I'd buy it in a heartbeat, if they allowed multi-select+tagging or some kind of paint interface that can apply a group of tag+collection info that I define.</p>
