    <div id="post">
      <p><a href="http://scripting.com/2013/12/28/microsoftAndNetbooks.html">Another gem</a> from the always spot-on Dave Winer. Microsoft could have owned netbooks.</p>
<p>The pathological need for large companies to focus on the wrong, to their own demise never ceases to amaze me. Why do dominant players lose out? Is it the incompetence of people in these companies? Is it the inability to articulate, convince, and move the masses within these companies?</p>
<p>Most often, it is the later. Perhaps, the collective, is bound to make safer choices and very often, the simple or obvious option is not the safe one.</p>
<p>It always comes down to doing the <a href="http://blog.ulrichsossou.com/2012/07/13/easy-vs-simple/">simple vs the easy</a>. Simple is hard!</p>
<p>P.S: I work for a large company. It is a daily struggle, irrespective of the domain of the choice -- design, code or cultural.</p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2013/07/how-to-apologize-to-your-users">How to apologize to your users</a></h1>

    <div id="post">
      <p>There has been an <a href="http://www.osaware.com/2013/05/03/a-timeline-of-companies-that-have-been-hacked-in-2013/">increase</a> in <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/ericbasu/2013/06/26/help-my-yahoo-account-was-hacked-forensic-on-the-latest-yahoo-attack/">security</a> <a href="http://www.pcgamer.com/2013/07/03/ubisoft-accounts-hacked-email-addresses-and-passwords-compromised/">breaches</a> this year. This past week, two services I use were compromised - <a href="http://staff.tumblr.com/post/55648373578/important-security-update-for-iphone-ipad-users">Tumblr</a> and <a href="http://www.loopinsight.com/2013/07/21/apple-comments-on-developer-site-hack/">Apple Developer Connection</a>. Both services informed me of the security breach, and one made me feel like they cared, and the other one didn't. Perhaps I am reading too much into this, but at the very least, it illustrates how important language is, in conveying how much we care.</p>
<p><img title="Apple Security Mail" alt="Apple Security Mail" src="/images/apple-sec-mail-468x300.jpg" /></p>
<p>Apple's mail is clear, concise and inspires confidence in their ability to take care of my information. They state the purpose of this communication, tell me what they did about it, and what they were going to do to fix it in the future. <em><strong>Update</strong>: Apparently, it was a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/21/apple-confirms-that-the-dev-center-has-potentially-been-breached-by-hackers/?hubRefSrc=permalink#lf_comment=87472293">whitehat security guy doing his thing</a>.</em></p>
<p><img title="Tumblr Security Mail" alt="Tumblr Security Mail" src="/images/tumblr-sec-mail-423x300.jpg" /></p>
<p>Tumblr on the other hand, makes a whole bunch of assumptions (NO! I don't read your staff blog), trivializes the security issue that was in their software (by ignoring to tell what it actually is), makes more work for me (change my passwords -- for my own good, but none-the-less), insinuates that I should be doing things to take care of my passwords by buying other apps, and finally, throws a completely insincere apology.</p>
<p>Nowhere do they bother to mention:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why they are getting in touch now</li>
<li>What the actual issue is (Some searching online explains why, but they should have mentioned it in the email)</li>
<li>That it was a Tumblr's fault (<a href="http://staff.tumblr.com/post/55648373578/important-security-update-for-iphone-ipad-users">Sniffed in transit</a> .. who sends un-encoded password over http anymore?!)</li>
</ul>
<p>The nonchalance of it all, really bothers me. Another small detail that Apple does well.</p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2013/05/inky-obsessions">Inky obsessions</a></h1>

    <div id="post">
      <p>Have I mentioned the long-standing obsession with stationery, especially, fountain pens? Well, it is a bit of problem, really. In the last few months, I have started hoarding them. It started with one-- a Lamy. Once I discovered how one can procure junk on eBay for very little money, I quickly ended up with a selection. As these things go, I suddenly had the increased "need" for inks that are not blue, or black. Nay, simple colours won't do for the truly obsessed.</p>
<p>Here is the result of the latest rotation of inks and pens.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_13780" align="alignnone" width="225"]<a href="http://blog.shiv.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Photo-2013-05-12-5-40-53-PM-e1368499228747.jpg"><img src="/images/Photo-2013-05-12-5-40-53-PM-e1368499228747-225x300.jpg" alt="Ink Rotation - May 12th" width="225" height="300" class="size-medium wp-image-13780" /></a> Ink Rotation - May 12th[/caption]</p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2013/03/reclining-airplane-seats">Reclining airplane seats : work of the Devil!</a></h1>

    <div id="post">
      <p>Reclining airplane seats!! I shake my fist at thee. This one feature on airplanes has caused me untold miseries. Ok! I exaggerate .. a little. I live Vancouver, which is one the other side of the planet with respect to my hometown. As a result, I spend at least 30 hours on an plane, once a year. To compound, my 6' 5" (196 cm) frame does not mix well with cramped spaces.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/life/a_fine_whine/2013/02/reclining_airplane_seats_are_a_terrible_idea_and_should_be_banned.single.html">Dan Kois on Slate</a>, says</p>
<blockquote><p>
  everyone on the plane would be better off if no one reclined; the minor gain in comfort when you tilt your seat back 5 degrees is certainly offset by the discomfort when the person in front of you does the same. But of course someone always will recline her seat, like the people in the first row, or the woman in front of me, whom I hate. (At least we’re not in the middle seat. People who recline middle seats are history’s greatest monsters.)
</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.marco.org/2013/02/19/reclining-airplane-seats">Macro</a> and <a href="http://www.kungfugrippe.com/post/43501810543/tilting-your-seat-back-on-an-airplane-is-pure">Merlin</a> agree.</p>
<p>Usually the conversation goes like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Me: "Sir/Ma'am, would you mind letting me know before you recline? My legs are up against the back of your seat, and if you do, my knees will be crushed."<br />
  Potential Recliner: "Sure!"<br />
  ...<br />
  ...<br />
  *[2 hours later]: The seat reclines *<br />
  Me: "Gaaaa!!!"
</p></blockquote>
<p>In the four legs of the journey, if I get one "recliner" in the seat in front of me, I usually spend about 10 hours standing. Yes, I used to pay for my seat, and stand all the way through.</p>
<p>For the love of god, next time, maybe a quick check might be a good idea before you decide to recline. This way, you will help save crushed knees of some poor-souls.</p>
<p>Note: Cathay Pacific has an <a href="http://www.terminalu.com/travel-blog/the-end-of-reclining-economy-seats-ana-removes-them-from-the-dreamliner/16703/">interesting solution</a>. <del datetime="2013-03-13T21:37:38+00:00">Their shell seats mean no reclining!</del>.</p>
<p>Later: I spoke too soon! Cathay has reverted to their <a href="http://www.terminalu.com/travel-blog/the-end-of-reclining-economy-seats-ana-removes-them-from-the-dreamliner/16703/">reclining seats</a>. Who cares about numb butts. Just get up and walk!</p>
