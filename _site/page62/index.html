<p>Check that article out. One of the most well-written, thought provoking articles in some time!</p>
<p>Anyway, I drove down to Pondy on my bike on Friday! Night ride with Tanigai and Prem. Peaceful, uneventful ride home. Was feeling very happy about it! Not for long. I met with an accident on Sunday morn, thrashed (well, almost. gonna cost me 2500 and upwards).</p>
<p>I was driving along one of the exits from Pondicherry, towards Villanur(my wife's College is on the way), and there was some ongoing repair work. A carrier auto, stopped for me (he was turning right). I went through to cross him, and there he was, 15 to 17 years of age, an idiotic blank grin that was telling me, oops sorry , I didn't mean to but I'm stupid, don't have a license to drive, but have a license to kill you! He was right there, stick his head out from behind the auto ( and his bike too) just a foot in front of me.</p>
<p>Wham!!! The next thing I knew was, I was standing there, blood oozing from my left foot, and one bystander and one policeman defending the stupid kid, just coz he is younger and has a smaller bike! "Get a life people", I thought and blew my lid off at the police guy for being such a whimp and at encouraing such bad driving practices on the roads.</p>
<p>well, wonder when, people on the roads be accused for their error in driving, rather than based on the size/cost of their vehicles!<br />

<p>Now that is what is happening in this world. Japanese gov is talking about getting a 2 hour moving into their people's homes in just 35 secs apiece! Is the Indian government listening ?!!<br />

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2004/08/damn-i-hate-the-traffic-in-chennai">Damn I hate the traffic in Chennai</a></h1>

    <div id="post">
      <p>Come on people! What's up with Chennai roads these days.. yeah I can understand that since the city is growing blah, blah, blah, it is going to be congested.... but you know there is this thing called sanity that departs you when it takes you an hour and half to get from Numgambakkam to Vadapalani!!<br />
<br />I hate it and I hate it and I hate it!! grrrrrrrr!!!<br />
<br />Well, it is madness I say, what's the point in selling bikes over 150 cc and cars the size of a Cessna if there is hardly any room for people to use their vehicles on! Our roads got to go bigger! I know, I know, don't you ask me how?! Figure out how, Corporation of Chennai!</p>
<p>Remove those stupid barriers that is supposed to regularize traffic! All they serve is to congest the roads even more. Take our infamous Arcot road! Who is that brainy road-designer (is that what you call 'em?) who thought that have a 8 feet road separator on a 40 feet road would ease traffic?! duh?! Get real guys!!</p>
<p>Why is that one has to ride through every conceivable road encroachment from your friendly petty shop to barricade perpendicular to traffic direction ( now, that must be the ingenuity of the Chennai Police! how does reducing the area usable by traffic, help control it?!) to dust bins to every thing that the Almighty created, smack on your path back home , right after you have negotiated, lane cutting autos and practically standstill rickshaws (bang in the middle of the road, not to mention!)</p>
<p>Well, I guess I'm a little stressed out, so out for a smoke me go! Gotta quit that one of these days, maybe will help do away with a few petty shops and a few more cig butts on our chennai roads!<br />
