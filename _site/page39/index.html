<p>After a long ride from Bangalore, whilst I was sleeping blissfully, some rascal, ran through our house, ate an apple, stole a couple of jars of Pickle (good ones at that), helped himself to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>My Philips DVD player (it was skipping at most DVDs anyway)</li>
<li>An old Sony Tape recorder/player (apparently, some was wrong with it, and needed replacement)</li>
<li>1 apple (worth Rs 25, but actually priceless since my wife got it for me)</li>
<li style="text-decoration: line-through">2 bottles of mushroom pickle</li>
<li>1 bottle of mushroom, and 1 bottle of (the famous) panchranga pickle (five types of fruit and vegetables)</li>
</ul>
<p>Ohh.. also he chased my cats out.</p>
<p>Well, looks as if nothing else is missing. Only the hollow feeling that someone invaded my den when I was sleeping. That kinda robs the secure feeling that one feels, when one is at home!</p>
<p>Whoever you are, you better not get caught, coz I really loved those bottles of pickle! (They were from Punjab - you see) :)</p>
<p>Update: Apparently, he flicked a pack of cigarettes also!! (He's even helping me quit smoking!!). Also a bottle of after-shave that my wife bought for me!</p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2007/02/xml-validator">XML Validator</a></h1>

    <div id="post">
      <p>It is quite surprising that there are hardly any open-source to validate XML out there. I had the need to validate a auto-generated XML output against a valid xsd, to see if the code that I wrote to generate XML was producing not only syntactically correct XML, but also XML that was data-valid. <strong>XML Validator</strong>, provides an&nbsp;UI that allows you to check the validity of any XML, in with reference to its xsd. It is free for Personal and Commercial use without any warranties. So don't come to me if it makes your dog barks all night, or if your computer commits suicide.</p>
<h2>Download it <a href="http://shvelmur.com/downloads/projects/XMLValidator.zip">here</a>.</h2>
<p><a href="http://shvelmur.com/images/wpress/XMLValidator_9477/XMLValidator14.png"><img height="175" src="/images/XMLValidator_thumb12.png" width="198" /></a> </p>
<h4><strong>Features (more like limitations now - :) )</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Compare syntactically valid XML against its XSD.  </li>
<li>Select files by using windows controls.  </li>
<li>No install required.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Known behavior</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Stops level traversal upon error.  </li>
<li>Uses MSXML parser/validator.  </li>
<li>Expects sub-elements to occur in the same order as defined.  </li>
<li>Both XML/XSD should be local files.  </li>
<li>If a namespace is used for the XML, it should be provided as input.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Features in future releases</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Support for multiple parsers
<ul>
<li>xerces  </li>
<li>xpp  </li>
<li>JDOM</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>CLI support for integration with test scripts.  </li>
<li>Validate XML syntax.  </li>
<li>Pick XSD from the URI (if mentioned).  </li>
<li>Read namespace from XML/XSD.  </li>
<li>Allow copy/paste XML/XSD.  </li>
<li>Allow URL as input source for XML/XSD.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a result of 30 mins of fiddling around with SharpDevelop, so it is not very complete nor does it have a lot of features. I would like to take it there. Your comments and suggestions for new features are welcome. </p>

    <div id="post">
      <p>Firstly, thanks Scoble.. I think I'll stop reading other gadget/tech sites .. you are my new feed filter.</p>
<p>Secondly, I got a whiff of yet another web 2.0 (does that even mean anything these days!) application site. <a href="http://www.nexo.com/">Nexo</a> is a wonderful wonderful site. just as Scoble says "It's Yahoo Groups done right". </p>
<p>It took me the whole of 1 min to create my account, invite a few friends and setup my own group. Oh yeah, it also provides me with web-space to put my photos etc.</p>
<p>One thing I would have loved to see, it someway to integrate this with my exisitng site. It's great that I have a nice dashboard, a place to interact with my friends, but I also want them to read some custom content. If only, I could provide a space where my network could read my RSS from NEXO. I know that's being a bit demanding, but hey it's Web 2.0 time. Integration is the key?! no?!</p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2007/02/crap-on-tv-is-that-even-news">Crap on TV - Is that even news?!</a></h1>

    <div id="post">
      <p>Yesterday, I was watching an interview with <a href="http://www.hackingmobilephones.com/">Mr Ankit Wadia</a> (His website describes him as "The Computer Security guru. The Ethical Hacker. The Author. The Intelligence Consultant. The Entrepreneur.")</p>
<p>He was talking about how the web is unsecure today and how easy it is to crack passwords. Whilst, I was eagerly awaiting in anticipation to see how he hack into a yahoo password, he pulled a bluff on me, when he asked the presenter to enter his password and then he went about using Revelation to read the password from it!</p>
<p>Now, Mr Wadia, do you really think that the Indian IT guys are so very dumb that you have to show how to use revelation?! I agree that most users in India are blissfully oblivious to the potential hazards and lack of privacy on the net, but come on! Can't you find any oft repeated behaviour that people use that you can show case?!</p>
<p>I am no security guru or even an ethical hacker or author of a book, but I can think of a few things that people often do that can be avoided.</p>
<ol>
<li>Using low strength passwords (children names, wife's name, dog's name etc)</li>
<li>Using the save password option in web-cafes</li>
<li>Using the same password across all accounts</li>
<li>reply to spam and phishing attacks with sensitive information</li>
<li>Giving away CVV numbers freely on the net</li>
<li>Publishing phone numbers and address on social networking sites like orkut/gazzag/yahoo profile etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>I wish that apart from getting on air to promote stuff that you do, you can also give some real examples of lack of common security practices, so that people really do get benefitted a little (so that they feel a little bit more justified in acknowleding you as India's only security guru - a wee bit self-proclaiming, wouldn't you say so?!)</p>

      <p>I have always wanted to be good at public speaking, especially in front of large audiences. Although, I can address a gathering without a shiver in my voice, I nonetheless feel butterflies in my stomach all the time!</p>
<p>I found some interesting links that might help soothe those tense moments!</p>

<p>Most times, one hardly derives anything at the end of an hour long technical presentation, and more often than not, the content of your presentation is lost after your audience exits the room.</p>
<p><a title="http://www.presentationhelper.co.uk/presentation_humor.htm" href="http://www.presentationhelper.co.uk/presentation_humor.htm">http://www.presentationhelper.co.uk/presentation_humor.htm</a></p>
<p>The author in the above link suggest that how adding some humor, may help in retentivity of the subject in the minds of your audience.</p>
<p>Very nice link that tells how humor is hidden in content more than in a few one-liners that you add to your speech.</p>
