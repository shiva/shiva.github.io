    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2008/10/twitter-client">Proposed GUI for C++ based twitter client</a></h1>

    <div id="post">
      <p>I got really sick of using Adobe AIR apps that take up more and more of system memory for an app that does twitter.</p>
<p>I've decided to put my "coding for myself" hat on and write a QT based C++ application (that should be cross-platform). No name as yet, but I will find something soon. QtTwitter is taken. Mebbe, once I have a working version, I can get ownership of the project on google code.</p>
<p><a title="Share photos on twitter with Twitpic" href="http://twitpic.com/i942"><img class="alignleft" src="/images/i942.jpg" alt="Share photos on twitter with Twitpic" width="150" height="150" /></a></p>
<p>That's the proposed GUI. Sorry for the bad light. The iphone cam's not too good with tungsten light.</p>
<p>Any suggestions?! I will try and post some mock up as I create em. I don't want to be writing my own twitter REST c++ library. Any suggestion are welcome.</p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2008/10/how-i-handle-emails">How I handle 1000+ emails and 300+ blog posts a day</a></h1>

    <div id="post">
      <p>Several people are shocked to hear that I read 1000+ emails and <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/shared/18301612726860782682">several hundred blog posts a day</a>. Ofcourse, when I say that, all I mean is that, I process that much content. I read around 30-40% (That is really the signal-to-noise ratio of web content these days--and that is, if you are subscribed to high quality feeds)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="450" caption="google reader trends"]<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/shvelmur/2945049781/"><img class="  " title="google reader trends" src="/images/2945049781_d005a9184b.jpg" alt="google reader trends" width="450" height="121" /></a>[/caption]</p>
<p>One of friends was curious how I can handle all that data flow, and I emailed her this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Everyday, go to bed with a zero count.</li>
<li>Use tools to reduce your processing. (use email rules/filters to move mails to manageable folders and Google reader for feeds)</li>
<li>Learn to skip-read. I use a 2 parse method.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Parse through sets of items (email headers or blog post headlines), and mark the ones your need to pay attention to (usually around 40%). </li>
<li>Filter based on short-listed items and then go through them in detail. In the case of blog posts, if something does retain my attention after the first 4 sentences, I skip that item.</li>
<li>(only for blog posts) I mark the ones I have to comment on, and then do my commenting after I finish a folder.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes, you just can't squeeze everything in a day, I either bookmark or mail it to myself to be addressed over the weekend.</li>
</ul>
<p>What do you think? Am I missing something that will make my life a little easier?</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Thanks to Aswinanand for pointing this out--I don't really get 1000+ emails. I was just exaggerating (which is just another way of saying, click-baiting! :) )</p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2008/09/webified-desktop-applications">Webified desktop applications</a></h1>

    <div id="post">
      <p>You know something is seriously out of whack, when you download a 12 MB application that is just a step above an ftp application. I know, a rant at such an ungodly hour! Yup! I have been up 2 hours past bed-time trying to upload a few high-resolution photos.</p>
<p>I found these shots of fireworks that I captured about two months back, and finally managed to sneak in some time to process these shots. I started my attempt at putting <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/shvelmur/sets/72157607481830420/">these</a> on my <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/shvelmur/">flickr account</a>, and <a href="http://www.stevey.com/2008/01/12/the-new-flickr-uploader/">the pitiful uploader V3</a>, has been failing for the last 2 hours! I doesn't seem to be the servers, since the 2.5 version works fine. Although, I must confess, I'm uploading files that are more than 5MB, and it's really just timeout issues.</p>
<p><a class="tt-flickr tt-flickr-Medium" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/shvelmur/2887342372/"><img class="alignnone" src="/images/2887342372_76fa1b7ecc.jpg" alt="Mirage of a once bright expression of light" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>What is with this craze for making all desktop applications suck, by re-writing the simplest of desktop apps in  javascript and its ilk I'm looking at you, AIR)? It's fine to use these heavy-weight stacks as a stop-gap solution. But, to turn a prefectly <a href="http://techiteasy.org/2007/12/20/bloatware-the-case-of-flickr-uploadr-3/">good app into mush</a>, in the name of multi-platform support is a crime--no less.</p>
<p>If you want to write multi-platform applications--use Java or some library like Boost. It also, helps to remember the main functionality, and ensure that works well--really well. An uploader, should never fail, when "uploading" stuff, an email client--should have reliable email dispatch, etc.</p>
<p>I wonder where this will lead us? Maybe 10 years from now, we will end up with a calculator application that will use 100 MB disk spave, and we wouldn't worry about it, coz our computers will have 10 GB of RAM and several  PetaHz processing power or some such crap. I'm not really looking forward to a future like that. Maybe, I should start that open source project for a native flick app after all.</p>
<p>Update: They are finally up...phew! Here's the fireworks collection:</p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2008/09/tandoori-spiced-fish-with-cucumber">Tandoori spiced fish with cucumber</a></h1>

    <div id="post">
      <p>One program--on Food TV--that I like to watch, is <a href="http://www.gordonramsay.com/corporate/theman/biography/">Gordon Ramsey</a>'s <a href="http://www.channel4.com/food/on-tv/ramsays-kitchen-nightmares/">Kitchen Nightmares</a>. He is such a powerful person, who is into what he does for a living. He has inspired me to get of my couch and cook decent food.</p>
<p>This is a recipe from his book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1554700647?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=shvelmurcom-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1554700647">Fast Food.</a> Every guy who wants to cook decent food should have on his shelf. A simple book, with simple recipes that any idiot (aka me) can follow. Most dishes are less than 30 minutes of cooking time.  I'm a very imprecise cook, and subtitute freely when I can't find a specific fish or condiment. I have taken the same liberty with this recipe as well.</p>
<p><a class="tt-flickr tt-flickr-Medium" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/shvelmur/2888542655/"><img class="alignnone" src="/images/2888542655_603b2e1c08.jpg" alt="IMG_5494" width="500" height="333" /></a> </p>
<p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>2 skinned Halibut fillets (about 150 gms), or cod, tilapia or turbot</li>
<li>1 tbsp Hot Madras Curry, or any non-sweet curry paste </li>
<li>1 tsp superfine sugar (optional)</li>
<li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
<li>2/3 cup (150 ml) plain yogurt</li>
<li>2 cucumbers, peeled</li>
<li>handful of mint leaves</li>
<li>lime juice</li>
<li>2 tbsp of vegetable oil</li>
</ul>
<p>Heat the oven to 400 F (200 C). Mix the curry paste, olive oil, sugar and all but 2 tbsp of the yogurt. Coat the fish with this mixture and set aside for atleast 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Cut the cucumber lengthwise (bâtonnet) and toss in the reserved yogurt, chopped mint and the lime juice. You want to be modest with the lime juice. Too much acidity can mask the taste of the fish.</p>
<p>Sear the fillets on an overproof pan--setting aside the excess marinade--for about 1.5 minutes on each side or until golden brown. If don't have an overproof pan, just use any skillet and a pre-heated baking pan.</p>
<p>Spoon over the marinade and place the pan in the oven and cook until done (the insides of the fish turns white and is flaky to cut). Transfer to a warm plate and serve with the cuccumber.</p>
<p> Now, wasn't that simple. Ramsey's a genius in creating simple foods.</p>
