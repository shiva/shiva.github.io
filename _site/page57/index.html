    <div id="post">
      <p>Yup, been a very long time since I blogged!! but I am back again!<br /><b>Thanks to my fellow util-seeker Sudhin for this bit of news<br /></b></p>
<p>Adobe Systems Incorporated (Nasdaq: ADBE) has announced a definitive agreement to acquire Macromedia (Nasdaq: MACR) in an all-stock transaction valued at approximately $3.4 billion. Under the terms of the agreement, which has been approved by both boards of directors, Macromedia stockholders will receive, at a fixed exchange ratio, 0.69 shares of Adobe common stock for every share of Macromedia common stock in a tax-free exchange. Based on Adob &rsquo;s and Macromedia&rsquo;s closing prices on Friday April 15, 2005, this represents a price of $41.86 per share of Macromedia common stock.</p>
<p>The combination of Adobe and Macromedia strengthens our mission of helping people and organizations communicate better. Through the combination of our powerful development, authoring and collaboration tools &#8211; and the complementary functionality of PDF and Flash &#8211; we have the opportunity to drive an industry-defining technology platform that delivers compelling, rich content and applications across a wide range of devices and operating systems.</p>
<p>By combining the passion and creativity of two leading-edge companies, we will continue driving innovations that are changing the ways people everywhere are experiencing and interacting with information.</p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2005/03/journey-with-a-book">Journey with a book</a></h1>

    <div id="post">
      <p>Started reading "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0440204887/102-0930866-9836102" title="Illusions" target="_blank">Illusions</a>" by Richard Bach. Often, I feel, that a book comes in your life, when you are ready for it. It presents itself, in ways you never would have imagined. I have heard of this book for the last 10 years. There has been a sopy at my parent's place (where I stayed for the better part of the last 10 years) and it never occured to me, to pick that small book (of about 200 odd pages) and give it a read.</p>
<p>This weekend has been a little disturbing, and when I was there lounging in my hall, on a Sturday hot afternoon, something caught the corner of my eye. This small book was jutting out admist the pile of rubbish that I have come to collect. It was odd. It was as if it was beckoning me to pick it up.. Urging me towards itself, a weird, yet sensible and completely discernable gravity...</p>
<p>I finally gave in, snapping out of the half-slumber, I picked it up and as the pages unfolded, so did the solutions to my worries. It was as if, this book was written a good 3 decades ago, with the full knowledge that a soul such as myself would want it, would benefit from the contents (immensly). Long live the hope of fateful coincidences!</p>

    <div id="post">
      <p><a href="http://news.com.com/Cabir+mobile+virus+found+in+U.S./2100-7349_3-5582302.html">FIR of a virus on a phone</a>! A very warm welcome to the world of computing! Soon we will need antiviral software running on our phones all the time and that would mean that your phones will get more processing power. If phones take the way PCs have, the day when we will have a phone with a huge Pentium or whatever processor and tons of RAM won't be too far away.</p>
<p>A little over-engineering I say. Today, I can't get a system, that can do a bare minimum of tasks, everything has everything else built-in. This, of course, is a double edged sword! Although it helps to bring the cost down, I will end up paying for things that I might never use! What is the use of a graphics card (on-board intel810) for a system that I shall primarily use for word-processing, email and some browsing!

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2005/02/woes-with-airtel-services">Woes with airtel services</a></h1>

    <div id="post">
      <p>What a lousy feeling it is, when you hold shares of a company, whose customer you have been for more than 2 years and have paid everyone of the bills in time, and when you have an issue, you are brushed under the carpet!That's what happened to me today. </p>
<p>I have been with Airtel (cell phone service provider in Chennai, India - for the uninitiated ;)) for the last two years. I had an automatic debit facility enabled. In January, the credit card I had enabled the auto-debit facility on expired. Airtel, promptly disabled the facility and disconnected my service asking me to call customer support. Well, I tried to do just that, but you know what?, the call to customer-care wouldn't go through coz they disconnected me!! Wonderful! </p>
<p>I travel to Pondicherry in the weekends, and incidentally it happened just after I boarded the bus on Friday. I managed to find an Airtel connect that was open on Saturday and paid my bill. However it took the whole of 3 working days to enable my account again! So much for being on a corporate plan! </p>
<p>Now comes the best part ... (hold your breath ;) ). I wanted to enable the auto-debit again and guess what you need to do? This being the age of the paperless office, you need to fill a two page form (about 30-40 fields in all), attach a photocopy of your card and submit the form at Airtel connect or you have the option of calling your corporate customer care executive to collect it from your office. Now that seems simple enough... Except that it takes four calls to person concerned and loads of cajoling to get him in the vicinity of your office, but then ofcourse he/she chooses to disregard your plight and ignore you. After the ignominy of such sorts, you brave to drive to the nearest Airtel connect office, which incidentally has been so well dispersed across town, so as to avoid proximity to any office building! (Good design always pays off you see)</p>
<p>You get there, finally after the torture of Chennai's traffic (see my <a href="http://www.shvelmur.com/current/2004/08/damn-i-hate-traffic-in-chennai.html">old article on Chennai's traffic</a>) just to find out that you are late by 30 seconds and you have to do the whole trip again. By this time, you are so fed up that the guy across the counter decides to leave his seat coz it gets really hot with the steam that is the result of your brain getting cooked, thanks to the wonderful, delightful service rendered to you after paying your bills in time for the last two years, having invested in the company coz your thought it was professionally run!</p>
<p>What you learn out this life changing event - <b>STOP USING CELLPHONES - THEY ARE INJURIOUS TO BODY AND MIND!</b>
