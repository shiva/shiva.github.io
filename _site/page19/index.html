    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2009/07/dreams-for-the-next-100-years">Dreams for the next 100 years</a></h1>

    <div id="post">
      <p>Over the weekend, I bit the bullet and bought a pair of really good speakers by KEF - the iQ70 series.</p>
<p><a href="http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/shiva/E4r2AzeUT1YFBixmK1hO5mgLIbxa9CslhbFmksV2ERruhs8OHyZeWBQkn3oL/IMG_0061.jpg"><img src="/images/IMG_0061.jpg.scaled.500.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>As I listened to them, for the last couple of days, I realised something that is, quite obvious, yet, goes unnoticed all the time. I wanted to show my parents how great this new set of speakers were. Even with all the advances in science and technology, I could not really convey how great the speakers sounded. It occured to me that there is no way to share experiences unless we share similar quality equipment. You could record video in HD, with a <a href="http://www.red.com/cameras/">RED camera</a>, but unless the person seeing it uses equally high quality display, there is no way, he/she is going to get the same experience you had. To some extent we have, acheived parity in display quality, and hence can convey images and video without losing much of the experience. However we are nowhere near ubiquitous when it comes to sound. Other factors like touch, thermal state, smell etc and completely beyond our prowess to express. However, we must pat ourselves in the back a little, coz in a matter of decades we've gone from a select few being able to communicate across great distances to several million all at once, in a matter of decades.</p>
<p>Maybe in the next 100 years, we'll be able to figure out how to use equipment that we already have in common, equipment that mostly has similar specs across every person in the world -- our brains (some are more active than others, but most have the capacity). If you thought, that living now is cool, coz of all the web 2.0 stuff, wait till you see brain 2.0.</p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2009/07/for-the-last-time-its-not-an-os">For the last time, its not an OS!</a></h1>

    <div id="post">
      <p>The last couple of days has been ablaze with news of Google taking over the world, destroying Microsoft and sticking all of humanity on stakes to collect sunlight and convert it to power. Obviously, <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/08/google-chrome-redefining-the-operating-system/">some are elated at this proposition</a>,Â  <a href="http://www.crunchgear.com/2009/07/08/a-third-opinion-on-google-chrome/">some tentative</a>, and then there are <a href="http://fakesteve.blogspot.com/2009/07/lets-all-take-deep-breath-and-get-some.html">some others</a> <a href="http://technosailor.com/2009/07/09/google-chrome-os-a-lot-to-do-about-nothing/">who think all of this is just hogwash.</a></p>
<p>I have but one thing to show you today. Presenting article number 1, a video by one of the minions at Google.</p>
<p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="580" height="360" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/o4MwTvtyrUQ&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;border=1" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="580" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/o4MwTvtyrUQ&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;border=1" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p>
<p>Here's a tip: people on Times Square have no, frigging, clue of what a browser is. Don't even get me started on, where the OS stops and the browser starts. The people you are trying to sell this to, don't give a shit. The people who do know what a browser is, think you are just crap-shooting them.</p>
<p>Oh, since I do know what a browser is, considering that I've used one since 95, I will say, that writing a shell on a linux kernel, and distributing it with only one app, does not make it an OS. It is a linux distro. I'm sure the following are familiar: Ubuntu, RedHat, Suse (Novell), which are all the same as Google Chrome (or atleast what they say it will be).</p>
<p>So Google, stop <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/07/introducing-google-chrome-os.html">messing with things that don't make you money</a> and go fix that bug in Gmail or Google reader or maybe you can add RSS support to blogs on blogspot (the rest of the sane world did that only 5 years ago). We, who use your "free" ad-filled products will be very pleased. Oh yeah, while you are at it, figure out a way to <a href="http://gigaom.com/2009/01/22/google-good-at-search-bad-at-investments/#comment-922970">monetize those millions you invested</a> in wonderful companies (Remember youtube, jaiku, jotspot, dodgeball, orkut, grandcentral ?! ). You might also want to consider improving this thing you helped invent -- search. I hear that there is a <a href="http://www.bing.com/">new-comer</a>. He sounds bad, and has a shitty name, but <a href="http://www.bing-vs-google.com/?q=google+chrome">he's getting better at it</a>.</p>
<p>Now, that's it for today's rant. Get off my lawn, I need to go google myself (Damn, this is therapeutic).</p>

    <div id="post">
      <p>This post is a little late, but that has never stopped me from doing it anyway. </p>
<p>There are some things that we need to regret ...<br />
<img src="/images/6a00d8341c59aa53ef011570bfc961970b.jpg" alt="Tiananmen tank man" title="Tiananmen tank man" width="620" height="412" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-528" /></p>
<p>And then there are some others, we continue to ignore ...<br />

<p>Hope we don't add more such pictures to that list in another 20 years.</p>
