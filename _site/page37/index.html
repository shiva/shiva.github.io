    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2007/02/lets-raise-our-voice-for-our-president-apj">Let’s raise our voice for our president APJ</a></h1>

    <div id="post">
      <p>Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam, has been, by far, the best president that India has ever had (atleast in my humble opinion). More than that, he has been one of the greatest ambassador of India and its culture.</p>
<p>He is the most energetic&nbsp;&nbsp;motivated I have known in my life. He is about to complete his term at the office of the President, and the following is a petition to extend his term at the helm of the country. I personally can't think of anyone who can do justice to that role, better than him. So please, let us join together and raise our voices, so that someone who has done the country a lot of good, can continue to do so.</p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2007/02/hell-via-sify-broadband">Hell via Sify Broadband</a></h1>

    <div id="post">
      <p><a href="http://shvelmur.com/images/wpress/HellviaSifyBroadband_CA0A/sifymail10.jpg" atomicselection="true"><img src="/images/sifymail_thumb8.jpg" style="border: 0px none " border="0" height="150" width="240" /></a></p>
<p>I had a hell of a time connecting using sify "narrow"band connection. After umpteen calls to sify call center, I decided to send mails to the CEO,CTO and Communications Officer of Sifycorp, to let them know of the pathetic state of affairs, and horrible experience of being a sify broadband user. I have attached a snapshot of the mail that I sent to them.</p>
<p>Here is the content of the mail in totem.</p>
<blockquote><p>Hi Ranjith,<br />
Firstly, my id with satyam broadband is SHVELMUR</p>
<p>I own a sify broadband connection for over the last one year.</p>
<p>I have spent more time contacting your technical staff than using your Internet connection in the last few months. Today, I had to sign in through your connection to attend a conference call (work related). I was unable to do so since my account was inactivated. So I called up your customer service 3 times (that's how many time you need to try to give you some business)and finally got hold of a customer executive, who took a request for renewal.I was initially impressed that only 3 calls were required to get some work done.</p>
<p>I was proved to be wrong. Five minutes after I started using your connection, in the midst of a chat with my customer, I lost connectivity. Not to be discouraged, I attempted calling your dreaded call center for a resolution. In 3 more tries, I got through to your customer care executive, and explained my urgency, raised a ticket and asked for a quick resolution or the phone number of the local operator in charge of my connection. Apparently, the information is not available to your agents, and hence was denied the phone number.</p>
<p>I waited for 2 hours, and called again, to get some status on the ticket and had a skill set abort. (your agent essentially cut the call on me)<br />
I called yet again, in about 20 mins time, and got in touch with Ms Latha, who provided me with your mail address.</p>
<p>After multiple interaction with your company in the last year, I'm completely disillusioned with your service, and hence I'm copying the CEO, the CTO, and the HR Head, hoping that they would be to some extent concerned about the pathetic situation at your enterprise.</p>
<p>By any chance if you want to reach me, you can respond using the following:<br />
web link : <a href="http://shvelmur.com/wpress/2007/02/24/hell-via-sify-broadband/">I posted this mail here.</a><br />
phone: 0413 2243583<br />
weekend mobile: +91 9894545527<br />
weekday mobile: +91 9901066344</p>
<p>If you can resolve/provide my with some status/the phone number of the local service provider (in my area - Pondicherry). Please send me the details.</p>

<p>I will keep you posted as to how responsive (or not) the sify guys are. Let us see if we can drive some efficiency and responsibility into our so-called giants of Indian IT.</p>
<p>Update: I guess to get prompt service, we need to raise a hullaboo and send mails to CEO, CTO and CCOs of the company. Well, atleast they did respond and I got a call within 10 minutes of the mail asking if my connection works. After about 30 minutes, they got it working. Good work, but next time, please do it before I send mails to your mom. :)</p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2007/02/thats-what-i-call-a-search">That’s what I call a "search"</a></h1>

    <div id="post">
      <p>I wonder what's happening to me. This is the third post in the last one hour. I must be going crazy. Anyway, this must the least used blog on earth, so what the heck. (I know there are a few of you out there, but you don't say much on my blog!! :( )</p>
<p>Before I bore you into leaving this page, here's what this post is about:</p>
<p><strong>Have you seen this somewhere?</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://shvelmur.com/images/wpress/ThatswhatIcallasearch_2C7/wear01_autumn07021.jpg" atomicselection="true"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="240" src="/images/wear01_autumn0702.jpg" width="160" border="0" /></a> </p>
<p>(Ohh.. for those who can't place that photo, isn't that a wallpaper that comes with Windows XP?!)</p>
<p>Nick Toshces, asked himself that, and didn't stop at that. He went about asking half the world. He bullied Microsoft, Bill Gates, a few of his friends and the photographer himself. So where is this place? Find out <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/ontheweb/features/2007/02/autumn200702?printable=true&curren;tPage=all" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>This is one problem that you wouldn't face with Windows Vista. Check out <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/01/25/1529570.aspx" target="_blank">this</a> and <a href="http://www.istartedsomething.com/20070126/finding-vista-wallpapers/" target="_blank">this</a>.</p>
<p>Jason Kottke, put me onto this. Thanks to you, Jason, for a wonderful feed. You are my <a href="http://kottke.org" target="_blank">link</a> to the world (pun intented).</p>
<p>Btw, if you find it difficult (lazy/bored), to load up my website, please use a feedreader. There are several out <a href="http://www.google.co.in/search?q=feed+readers&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a" target="_blank">there</a>. I use <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/view/" target="_blank">Google reader</a>, which is probably google's best app till date, apart from search and gmail. You can read it from anywhere, including my new <a href="http://shvelmur.com/wpress/2007/02/15/new-phone-nokia-n73/" target="_blank">Nokia N73</a>, which I think is a pretty amazing feature. (I can't share from my mobile - such a drab)</p>
