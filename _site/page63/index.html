<p>Come on old man! Get your grips on. You go on to tell the entire world that you have to attend a secret meeting?! Duh?! That kind of beats the purpose of a secret meeting uh?!</p>
<p>Well, one has to appreciate the efforts of a president, if he thinks that he wants to tell his unedited opinion about things to the people of the world. That is worth applause. It is not that I concur with all his opinions, but if we had a leader or two, who would pick up blogging and will read through the comments that the people give to his opinions, India can become a far better place?!</p>
<p>Don't you think so?</p>

<p>Check out this site!!! Mozilla Thunderbird rules. Finally, a mail client that can handle about 500 MB of mail, blogs, newsfeeds etc. and it is customisable and there are some very neat plugins on the net, if you are interested.</p>

<p>This book , "<em>The Da Vince Code</em>" (DVC), by <strong>Dan Brown </strong>is a must read by every person who has ever read a fiction novel. The most gripping tale that I've heard/read in quite some time.</p>
<p>The audacity of the author to lay questions about the foundations of the one of the most populous religions in this world has to be applauded. Further, he raises questions that make you question yourself!. Now ever, heard of a fiction autor make you do that.</p>
<p>A paperback that makes you think! Now that's a new one.</p>
<p>Btw, if you like the DVC, you might also want to take a peek at "<em>The unauthorised guide to the DVC</em>"  by <strong>Dan Burstein</strong>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2004/08/getting-screwed-for-doing-the-right-and-wrong">Getting screwed for doing the right and wrong</a></h1>

    <div id="post">
      <p><span style="font-family:verdana;">This blogging thingy is turning out to be good. It let's you interface with people and take a sneak peek into their minds, (which btw, I think has been the most characteristic search of humankind in the last century - a peek into the evolving human mind) without tramping on their time or egos!</p>
<p>anyway, on my wayward browsing adventure, I happened to look at a quote posted on one of the blogs by </span><a href="http://rainy.net/"><span style="font-family:verdana;">Heather</span></a><span style="font-family:verdana;"></p>
<p>"I'd say I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I'm not. I excel at not giving a shit. Experience has taught me that interest begets expectation, and expectation beget disappointment, so the key to avoiding disappointment is to avoid interest. A equals B equals C Equals A, or whatever. I also don't have a lot of interest in being a good person or a bad person. From what I can tell, either way, you're screwed. Bad people are punished by society's laws, and good people are punished by Murphy's Law. So you see my dilemma." - Georgia Lass" - <strong>Dead Like Me </strong></p>
<p>Now, how true is that. How many times, have we thought that everytime that we do something real good, we get screwed up for it, and the smallest of demeanors that we are put under the microscope! - well that's life for you!!</p>
<p>and Heather - that you quote, probably echoes the sentiments of most of us in the last two and half decades, with world we live in turning more and more cynical by the day!</span><br />
