<blockquote><p>What are the hallmarks of a great engineer? A great engineer is characterized by their intelligence, versatility, creativity, loyalty, passion, experience, vision, dedication, composure, humility, and ability.</p></blockquote>
<p>Apart from the "humility" part, which he never cared for, Steve Jobs was the epitome of that description. We shall miss you Mr. Jobs, especially for that keen sense of doing something perfectly.</p>

      <p>And sometimes, they barely hold your attention. However, the recent acquisition is the former. I got the mammoth of a book, over the weekend; it weighs a ton and I'll be sleeping with it, clutched tight in my hands.</p>
<p>If you already have the tomb by tanenbaum of similar name, the unix programming interface, you probably are not going to glean much value from this one (you can thank POSIX for maintaining a modicum of consistency over the years and some would vehemently contest that). That said, if you write code for *nix systems, it definitely deserves the shelf-space as much as any other programming book. </p>
<p>In the few hours I've spent with it, I've already learnt and have had a few concepts made clear. It is definitely not a linear read and there is quite a lot of interesting things to read about. I'm currently working through some fun tests of my understanding of pthreads. Watch for those <a href="https://github.com/shiva/fun">here</a>.</p>

    <div id="post">
      <p>If you write a lot of scripts to automate tasks, you probably already know this. However, if you don't, and you are still reading, you are probably a programmer, in which case, you really should be learning how to script in BASH!</p>
<p>A couple of pointers for you:<br />
1. Using a -x, in the shebang line "echo"s every line before executing. This turns out to be quite useful for debugging shell scripts<br />
2. It's quite easy to make BASH print a countdown. </p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2011/08/dump-fb-for-gplus">10 reasons to dump Facebook for G+. Now!</a></h1>

    <div id="post">
      <p>A friend asked what I like about google+, and as I started posting a reply , I noticed there were enough to make a blog post. So here goes...</p>
<p>Here's a quick list:<br />
1. Mobile app on android and iphone are awesome!<br />
2. Automatic upload of pics on phone/picasa<br />
3. Non-crappy photos (allows 2400+px, and g+ renders pictures better, since they don't mess with the image, if it is smaller than the max size)<br />
4. Easier to mention specific people in a conversation. (auto-completes ppl's profile name)<br />
5. hangouts (free video conferencing)<br />
6. Group messaging done right (huddle) on the mobile phone<br />
7. decent integration with email (I guess this is just coz I use Gmail)<br />
8. Privacy - predictable and manageable (not that it matters to me)<br />
9. Much less noise (a - mostly used by techies for now, b - allows asymmetric relationships à la twitter)<br />
10. Keyboard shortcuts (J, K work. Someone at google like vi  -- a lot)</p>
<p>So, there's 10 reasons to dump Facebook for G+. There is a lot more in terms of features (new ones are added all the time), but mostly the community is awesome, and the engagement is better!</p>
<p>11. (bonus). I was going to say games, but they have that here too, but I'm not bothered by it, and don't have to see someone's update on buying sheep</p>
<p>Having said the above, I miss a couple of FB "features". Really, its the of the same: 1. There is no way to start a conversation with someone, unless, you address it specifically to that person (in which case nobody else see it). Facebook does this simply, by providing a "wall". </p>
<p>2. There are no "Groups". Ie each circle is local to me, and hence, if I want to have a group for all my friends from university, I will have to add them to a circle. In order to simulate Facebook "groups", everyone in that circle, has to add everyone else to a group of the same name. Adding one more person to that group, now means that everyone has to add that person manually.</p>
<p>I'm sure, google will come up with something to address the above two. We'll have to wait and see how it goes!</p>
