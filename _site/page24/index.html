    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2008/09/in-the-browser-lies-the-power-wave-2-of-the-google-takeover">In the browser lies the power - Wave 2 of the Google takeover</a></h1>

    <div id="post">
      <p>Finally it's out in the open. The ultimate weapon in Google's powerchest to combat desktop applications, render the need for a specific platform meaningless - the browser. I guess this has been in the making for the last decade, and here it is. A browser by a company that downloads pretty much most of the internet every day.</p>
<p>If you are still reading this, you shouldn't be. Get outta here and <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/09/fresh-take-on-browser.html#">read this</a>. (Actually just open in a new window, and continue reading this).</p>
<p>I guess it makes a lot of sense for a company like Google to have an install base of their own, and what better way than, what has become the primary application on most computers, the browser. With Google's data processing and storage capabilities, I can't begin to imagine the things that could be done with a browser like this.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Some unique things about (I stand corrected, David)</span> Key features of Google Chrome (such a lame name .. come on guys you can be a bit more creative than that -- too many Mozilla hackers @ Google?!), as mentioned in their <a href="http://www.google.com/googlebooks/chrome/">cartoon booklet</a> (if you care to read thru 40 pages), include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tabs to the top (ignore that - such a cosmetic change) - Aparently this has been around for a while in Opera - thanks David Sheen</li>
<li>Tabs as <a href="http://www.google.com/googlebooks/chrome/images/4.jpg">separate processes</a> (that's good in a way, but I'm not so sure about older machines)</li>
<li>New <a href="http://www.google.com/googlebooks/chrome/images/7.jpg">garbage collection engine. </a></li>
<li>New <a href="http://www.google.com/googlebooks/chrome/images/14.jpg">javascript virtual machine</a>, that supports <a href="http://www.google.com/googlebooks/chrome/images/15.jpg">compiled javascript</a> - I want to see the performance on that.</li>
<li>Apparently, they have a huge testbed, that can <a href="http://www.google.com/googlebooks/chrome/images/10.jpg">test each browser build</a> automatically using a hundred monkeys. (I don't care too much about this, I just think this is over-engineering, but hey, this is me).</li>
<li>Uses <a href="http://www.google.com/googlebooks/chrome/#">Webkit for page-rendering</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.google.com/googlebooks/chrome/images/18.jpg">Persistant tab state</a>, and the tab can be detached as well, into a new window.</li>
<li>Standard <a href="http://www.google.com/googlebooks/chrome/images/19.jpg">auto-completing address bar</a> (Firefox 3)</li>
<li>Personalised start page <a href="http://www.google.com/googlebooks/chrome/images/21.jpg">with your browsing history, google info etc.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>As a write this, a huge array of ideas come to mind, that will surely come to be common-place in next few years. I'm throwing out some general ideas here, and maybe I'll come back a few years and tick some of them down.</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Personalised homepages with per-user google content</span> (this is already present in their beta vision)<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"><br />
</span></li>
<li>Single sign-on using open id and o-auth using google account information (read as identity management)</li>
<li>Social networking (submit to orkut etc), location aware</li>
<li>Voice calls from the browser (gtalk, jaiku etc)</li>
<li>Content tagging services, using collective intelligence (this could make google searches much better than they already are - something like mahalo + google, just that every click could potentially give google data, thereby bettering the result match for you.)</li>
</ol>
<p>That's my five things google could do. What do you think? What could Google add to their browser, that willl change the way we use it in the next 5 years?</p>

<p>Thank you Mr. Raghavan Iyer. This is the man, that wrote the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0761148558?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=shvelmurcom-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0761148558&quot;">660 Curries</a>, that has initiated me into making proper Indian food. In the last month or so, since my return from my vacation to India, I have tried eating good food, and have found cooking a very rewarding activity. It helps you think more about what you want to put in your mouth and somehow, also makes you eat less!</p>
<p>I made some chicken curry last weekend, and here's the recipe: (I didn't have some stuff and used some substitutes instead)</p>
<p>2   tbsp of Canola oil<br />
1/2 tsp. cloves (Didn't have any of these :) )<br />
4 green or white cardamom pods (I didn't use any though)<br />
2 fresh or dried  bay leaves<br />
2 cinnamon sticks<br />
4 medium-size cloves of garlic, finely chopped<br />
2 slices of ginger (2 tsp of ginger)<br />
1 large tomato, cored and finely chopped.<br />
2 tsps of garam masala<br />
1 tsp of salt<br />
1 1/2 pounds of chicken thighs cut into 1-inch pieces<br />
(thighs taste better, but I used chicken breasts instead - lower in fat)<br />
1/2 cup of chicken broth<br />
4 tbps of heavy whipping cream<br />
2 tbps of fresh, finely chopped cilantro leaves and some tender sprigs for garnishing</p>
<p><strong>Optional:<br />
</strong>1 large onion finely chopped (I just wanted some extra flavour)<br />
4 hard boiled eggs (my addition, ofcourse :) )</p>
<p><strong>Here's how you make it:</strong><br />
1. Heat the oil in a medium skillet, and fry the cloves, cardamom, bay leaves and cinnamon sticks until light brown (1-2 mins)<br />
2. Add the onions, and fry until golden brown.<br />
3. Add the tomatoes, ginger, garlic, garam masala and salt. Cook until tomatoes are done, but still firm to touch. (3 to 5 mins)<br />
4. Stir in the chicken and the broth. Bring the curry to a boil and let it simmer until the chicken is done. (10 - 15 mins). Remember not to overcook the chicken breast, since it becomes quite rubbery and hard.<br />
5. Fold in the cream, and stir to blend the cream in. Make small incisions in the hard boiled eggs and add them to the curry, and roll over the sauce. Cover and allow the curry to warm up again. Be careful not to overcook after the cream, since you don't want the fat in the cream to separate.<br />
6. Serve the curry with the eggs over a bed of steaming white basmati rice.</p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2008/07/movie-review-the-dark-knight-spoiler-alert">Movie Review: The Dark Knight (spoiler alert)</a></h1>

    <div id="post">
      <p>In a moment of mild insanity (actually more like boredom), I decided to watch the last show last night. I was plesantly surprised to find that the movie was playing in 2 theatres @ <a href="http://www.cineplex.com/Theatres/TheatreDetails/C5CEF4DF/SilverCity_Coquitlam.aspx">Silvercity, Coquitlam</a>. With all the <a href="http://news.google.ca/news?hl=en&amp;q=batman">hype</a>, and the huge <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/SHOWBIZ/Movies/07/20/boxoffice.ap/index.html">revenue generation</a> in the first week, the movie does deliver most of what it promises.</p>
<p>Before you start reading the rest of the post, there are few items, that could give away the plot. I wonder if one needs to worry about the plot in Batman. Here's the <strong>short version</strong> of the review - <strong>watch it if you haven't done so as yet. NOW!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Some things I liked:</strong></p>
<p>1. The movie is a lot more serious than previous renderings of Batman. Finally, a Batman movie, where you don't have to laugh at Batman.</p>
<p>2. The Joker (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005132/">Heath Ledger</a>) was truly amazing. I liked that he retained the southern sounding voice. Heath shines like diamond, and really stands out in terms of his performance. It is such a pity that the world has lost such a wonderful actor. He could have been this generation's Brando or Pacino. He has set new heights for the Batman villian (Traditionally, the villians have been better actors anyway)</p>
<p>3. Batman is real, he gets hurt and has his flaws, and I don't hear "kapow" or "zing" during the action sequences.</p>
<p>4. Makeup was wonderful - both the Joker and Two-Face, are more believable and frightening in their own ways.</p>
<p>5. This movie has one of the best casts in all Batman movies (For a franchise, that has always had a star cast, this one really get the right people for the roles - remember <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000123/">George Clooney</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000216/">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a> anyone?!)</p>
<p>6. Thankfully, no robin - nuff said.</p>
<p>Now for some things that <strong>could have been better</strong></p>
<p>1. 2:35 mins - the show started at 10:00 PM and ended at 1:00 AM! 3 hours is way too long (even for Indians - we get an intermission for our 3 hour movies).</p>
<p>2. Two villians too big for this movie. I thought the villians didn't get enough screen time.</p>
<p>3. Two-Face's plot is quite unconvincing, and it's a pity he's killed with such little damage. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001173/">Aaron Eckhart</a> is no match for <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000169/">Tommy Lee Jones</a>.</p>
<p>4. I hate the new Batman's voice. What's with the constant growling. I think that's the only flaw with the new Batman. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000288/">Christian Bale</a>, should learn to show some emotion through his eyes (wrath, anger, hatred etc). I liked him much better in the first movie. He has shown good promise, and if he does a couple more, I can see him as one of the better Batmans. I must say, the best one (my opinion) was <small> </small><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000474/">Michael Keaton</a>. I always liked the quirky Batman. This more dark Batman, closer to the comic, impresses as well, but yet to prove himself. I think he needs a villian who really pushes him hard.</p>
<p>All in all, a very enjoyable 3 hours, if you have the penchant for Batman, and can hold the large Combo in your bladder long enough. Must see movie. Don't miss it! Now, check out the trailer. (Kudos to Warner Bros. for providing an embeddable version).</p>

<p>As I was rummaging through my old pictures, I found this one and liked the pastel colours of the evening sky. This was shot a few months back, I have over 3 months backlog of images to be processed. Let me know what you think.</p>
