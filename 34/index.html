      <p>Philipp Lenssen, has an interesting (scary) thought about the day that google acquired the world (aka internet :) ). The date that he has chosen, 12 May 2017, sent a shiver up my spine. I, definitely, don&rsquo;t want to see the world taken over by the most efficient search engine on my birthday!! :) That would be some scary stuff to wake up too.
Since we are on the subject of acquisitions, google paid over $3 billion for doubleclick, a company that google didn&rsquo;t beleive in when it wanted to serve ads in the first place.</p>

      <p>Me and thousands of other people, continue to use wordpress, one of the leading blog management systems (sounds kewl, eh? ;) ), and proof that is it in fact leading is here.
Apparently, Wordpress.com, has the least spam, compared to other free blog-hosting services. The honored list of competitors, include the likes of google, myspace and AOL, each one of them goliaths! Matt Mullenweg, the creator of Wordpress, associates the success of wordpress.</p>

      <p>I have a dual-boot PC at home, which boots to OpenSUSE and Windows. After a very tiring 7 hour journey, I came home to a GRUB failure. After searching for help all over the web, I found some help here, here, here, here, here and here. :)
It turns out, that GRUB stage 2 was not being loaded. So here&rsquo;s what I did.
1. set the root partition
2. run GRUB setup on the MBR.</p>

      <p>Yipeee!! Just one word - Fantabulous.
The most painless install ever. Well, actually, I haven&rsquo;t yet completely migrated to Ubuntu, but I just might. Today, I downloaded the latest beta of Ubuntu codenamed&quot;Feisty Fawn&quot;. The thing that amazed me was that it had to use a restricted driver to get my Wireless working, but it did detected it and also most other hardware on my laptop. Amazing how far linux has come in the last couple of years.</p>

      <p>I ought to resist the temptation of writing posts full of only links to other blogs .. but this one is good
http://www.douglaskarr.com/2007/03/25/selling-news-is-dead/
He talks about how &ldquo;selling news is dead&rdquo;. I thinks he hits the nail on the head with this one. When was the last time, that you read/saw, a news items that was worth buying the newspaper for?
I can hardly remember the time, I needed to pick a newspaper, let alone buy one.</p>
