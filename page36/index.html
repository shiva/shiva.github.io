    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2007/03/ms-vs-apple-which-is-more-secure">MS Vs Apple: Which is more secure?</a></h1>

    <div id="post">
      <p>Marius Oiaga of <a href="http://www.softpedia.com/" target="_blank">Softpedia</a> News argues that <a href="http://news.softpedia.com/news/Windows-Vista-More-Secure-than-Mac-OS-X-49487.shtml" target="_blank">Windows Vista is more secure than MAC OSX</a>, on the grounds that there are more security patches for MACOSX in a 1 month period. Now, how naive is that?!! Developers at Microsoft are probably just catching their breaths after years of trying to get Windows Vista out of the "window" (excuse the pun).</p>
<p>Now, why is Mac OSX more secure that Windows. Well, you never need to run as administrator (root, in unix speak) to get all applications to work efficiently. Since it is based on BSD unix (FreeBSD), Mac OSX' architecture is definetely much more secure. Also, take into account, the fact, that there are only 6% of users on Mac OSX, and hence proves to be a very unlikely target for security breaches.</p>
<p>I guess the answer to your security woes, go use an absolutely obscure OS. No one will ever trouble you or you can switch to almost any linux platform (Think <a href="http://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.freebsd.org%2F&amp;ei=ucr7ReSADZqksALhi8jsDg&amp;usg=__gClc_OV6MQNpLPeQPoqlxj0nj50=&amp;sig2=RNJPU0swzl7A-WS-wWRzaQ" target="_blank">FreeBSD</a>, <a href="http://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.opensuse.org%2F&amp;ei=tcr7RYS-D6i0sAL3zYXnDg&amp;usg=__86AC-jrJroIybeDdZDNvQU0Ja4I=&amp;sig2=XrYt_ab6348sdmt8dJPqkw" target="_blank">OpenSuse</a> or <a href="http://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ubuntu.com%2F&amp;ei=v8r7RbmsJJWisALssP3lDg&amp;usg=__4QTMs1DXM_6D16Pjwdd35LWEgwg=&amp;sig2=3AQ5XUC8wVNjpZ41UXqzVg" target="_blank">Ubuntu</a>)</p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2007/03/meeting-old-friends">Meeting old friends</a></h1>

    <div id="post">
      <p>After moving to bangalore (it's been 3 months already!!), I never had an opportunity to got visit good friends who have moved here. Last weekend, I managed to find time to meet up with my old pals.</p>
<h5><strong>Koushik<a href="http://shvelmur.com/images/wpress/Meetingoldfriends_A7BB/1003200712626.jpg" atomicselection="true"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 0px 10px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="177" src="/images/10032007126_thumb24.jpg" width="132" align="right" border="0" /></a></strong></h5>
<p>Introducing, Koushik. a very good friend from Pondicherry. He is currently work as a Project Manager (yup, the youngest there!) at Accenture. This giant of flesh and bone (much like me) is a strict veggie and drinks non-alcoholic wine only (I tried it but ... ugh). </p>
<p>If you want to know anything, I mean anything at all, about western music, especially rock, jazz, instrumental, classical go to this guy! He is a huge encyclopedia of music. Everytime I meet with him, I end up getting introduced to new kinds of music. Off late, he is into John Mclaughlin, Sakthi, Mahavishnu Orchestra. </p>
<p>Thanks Koushik for the great lunch, and also the wonderful music you have introduced to me through all these years. If you want to get in touch with this guy, use the comments section. </p>
<h5><strong>Dinesh 'SPB clone' Sivaraj </strong></h5>
<p>Another good friend, <a href="http://shvelmur.com/images/wpress/Meetingoldfriends_A7BB/1103200713431.jpg" atomicselection="true"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; margin: 10px 15px 0px 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="156" src="/images/11032007134_thumb29.jpg" width="208" align="left" border="0" /></a>fed me dinner on Sunday. Dinesh is the god of all things in networking (atleast for me :) ). He has completed his CCIE qual, and is currently working at Juniper Advanced TAC. He is also a great singer/composer/arranger/ ohh a lot more! Great skill at mixing music using his Nuendo-enabled, JBL speakered-workstation. He has a stunner kid, Shaan. </p>
<p>I had a great time with you guys this weekend. Thanks for the yummy chicken you fed me! :) </p>
<p>He is a great guy in general (Dinesh, you have to give me more food, if you want more of this kind of praise&nbsp;:D). You can get in touch with this guy too, via the comments section. </p>
<p>P.S: If you are from ODC, please, I say, please, refrain from teasing dinesh (:x&gt; wink, wink)</p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2007/03/the-zen-of-photo-management">The zen of Photo Management</a></h1>

    <div id="post">
      <p>I have been <a href="http://shvelmur.com/wpress/sharpalbum/">rambling</a> for the last month or so, about the need for better photo management. Having acquired a N730 recently, I have started shooting more and more pictures, and the chore of organising them, and sharing them has been such a bore, that I haven't uploaded a single picture.</p>
<p>Well, to change that I launched into building one myself to suit my own needs, only to discover that someone has already thought of most of it and has built a product and a service around it.</p>
<p>Introducing SharpCast.... the ultimate photo management solution. Unlimted space, web 2.0 website, client for syncing multiple image sources like, your mobile phone, Laptop, PCs.. and the list goes on.</p>
<p>Go ahead, <a href="http://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sharpcast.com%2F&amp;ei=EOPvRaO7HZj-gwPbttjnCQ&amp;usg=__x6u1oce_6zGi1Z-LrD1pjc5MAq4=&amp;sig2=HZt2zw6nPowOgv1c2XjJFQ" target="_blank">try it</a>. Check out my photos <a href="http://www.sharpcast.com/photos/user/shvelmur/albums?album=11428_49082886258813" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>I'm going to try and see if we can leverage the photo management infrastructure that is provided by SharpCast and build something out of that.</p>
<p>I'm thinking,</p>
<ol>
<li>Plugin for wordpress</li>
<li>AJAX based slideshow</li>
<li>Photo blog sync</li>
</ol>
<p>I have posted a request on their forums, and will keep you updated on that. </p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2007/03/website-clean-up">Website clean up</a></h1>

    <div id="post">
      <p>I've been hosting this site for over 2 years now. Nothing much has come of it, except satisfying my own ever-growing obsession with all things that are related to "The Web".</p>
<p>Over time, I have managed to accumalate a lot of unwanted scripts, html files, tools and code snippets, that I have randomly uploaded to my website. It is a junkyard of sorts, and several attempts at clean it up has ended in adding more crud.</p>
<p>I'm attempting to clean up my online junkyard, yet again, just as <a href="http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/southasia/History/Mughals/mahmud_mughals.html" target="_blank">Mahmud of Ghazni invaded the Indian sub-continent 17 times</a>. Here are few things that I'm doing, which are keeping me from posting, not to mention a 1000 entries in my google reader, loads of work at office, the <a href="http://shvelmur.com/wpress/sharpalbum/" target="_blank">impending release of #Album</a> and not to mention <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/shared/14480565058256660224" target="_blank">Mr. Scoble, who doesn't let me sleep</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>Conform to <a href="http://no-www.org"><img src="/images/blog-button.gif" title="No-www.org" alt="No-www.org" border="0" /></a>.</li>
<li>Remove all static html files</li>
<li>Separate tech items from normal blog. (I'm thinking of using wordpress categories to do this)</li>
<li>Install <a href="http://www.google.com/a/" target="_blank">google-apps</a> on a sub-domain.</li>
<li>Uninstall all tools (photoblog etc)</li>
</ol>
<p>Apart from those, here are a few ideas that continue to crowd my mind.</p>
<ol>
<li>Gadgets for google desktop to connect with google notebook</li>
<li>Plugin to publish google notebook to blog (think WLW and Wordpress)</li>
<li>Extend <a href="http://shvelmur.com/wpress/projects/wpexapi/">wordpress extended RPC</a> to support getTagSuggestions()</li>
<li><a href="http://www.feedmap.net/" target="_blank">Feedmap</a> plugin for wordpress.</li>
</ol>
<p>So If you are interested in working on any of the ideas listed above or listed <a href="http://shvelmur.com/wpress/2007/01/30/plugin-ideas-for-windows-live-writer/">here</a>, or if you have a solution that solves some of the stuff I'm trying to do, do get in touch with me.</p>
<p>In other news....</p>
<p>Also, in my online surfing adventures (on Google reader), I came across <a href="http://bink.nu/Article9664.bink" target="_blank">this gem</a>. Finally, there seems to be some sanity out there. Product Manager(s) of Ms Office have realised that it is not enough if they make good products, but also keep customers happy in doing so. OpenXML is now finally "open", thanks to <a href="http://novell.com" target="_blank">Novell</a> (&lt;-- I work here :) ), which has created a <a href="http://odf-converter.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">OOXML plugin for open office</a> (I guess I'm a little late to the game here).</p>
<p>As usual, the <a href="http://boycottnovell.com/category/open-xml/" target="_blank">nay</a>-sayers, who now seem to be persistent upon the idea that companies need to be charitable organisations instead of making money for their shareholders. To them , I say, "Go buy some Novell or Microsoft shares, hold them for 2 years and then talk of product strategy. They will listen to you then :) "</p>
<p>Ok. No more talk. Pressing Publish!!</p>

I know, that the flavour of the day is re-mixing movies, but I must confess.. what a re-make? Amazing movie! I was simply blown away by the pathos of the story, the power of Amitabh's eyes and the great performances of every single character.</p>
<p>Personally, I think, this is the best performance by Amitabh. yes.. even more than Black. He has truly scaled peaks that probably most actors in the world can ever see. Finally, a movie that has created some hope for bollywood and the Indian film industry. We have class, we are the masters of pathos. We can do with more Nishabd's. Mr. RGV, are you listening?</p>
