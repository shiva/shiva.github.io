      <p>The reason for the respite in my blogging, was my move to a new web-host. After several hours of researching, I decided to go with webfaction.com. If you haven&rsquo;t already visited webfaction, DO IT right now! It has been simply amazing. I love the one click installer, and within hours of getting billed, I got access to my account. It comes with shell access, SFTP, enough space, rails 2.x (just days after it was release), django, wordpress 2.</p>

      <p>That is a very difficult question to answer (which I don&rsquo;t answer anywhere in this post: go away). Anyone who attempts to do so, must be a genius or a fool, perhaps a little of both. Philipp Lenssen on Google Blogoscoped, observes how one of those is true. Here is a more detailed analysis.
John Watkins, must have been quite a visionary considering the depth of his predictions and how much of it has come true.</p>

      <p>I recently got myself a Canon 40D. After a 3 year wait, I can finally afford to buy myself a DSLR, and have been going crazy with it for the last couple of weeks.

larger version.
Largely influenced by Thomas Hawk&rsquo;s passion, I have started carrying the camera everywhere I go: to work, when I go shopping, and even when I am just walking around the neighbourhood. I shot this picture, on my back from work, last Friday.</p>

      <p>Dang! I got stung today, by a bee, for the first time in my life. The little critter was trying to sniff some aroma from the back of my head, and I reached out with my hand, grabbed him (sorry, it must of hurt), and he got pissed and wanked me. Just as any normal, crazed-out geek would do, the first thing I did was to search the net for home-grown, bee sting remedies and I found this post by William Brantley.</p>

      <p>First off, this is a rant. You have been warned.
I have been banking with ICICI bank for the last 6 years. I have generally had a pleasant experience banking with them, since you could do pretty much everything you want to do with your account through their online interface. With my recent move to Canada, I was pleased to see an branch here in Vancouver.
I opened an account with them last week, and had used a check to make the initial deposit.</p>
