      <p>One program&ndash;on Food TV&ndash;that I like to watch, is Gordon Ramsey&rsquo;s Kitchen Nightmares. He is such a powerful person, who is into what he does for a living. He has inspired me to get of my couch and cook decent food.
This is a recipe from his book, Fast Food. Every guy who wants to cook decent food should have on his shelf. A simple book, with simple recipes that any idiot (aka me) can follow.</p>

      <p>You know something is seriously out of whack, when you download a 12 MB application that is just a step above an ftp application. I know, a rant at such an ungodly hour! Yup! I have been up 2 hours past bed-time trying to upload a few high-resolution photos.
I found these shots of fireworks that I captured about two months back, and finally managed to sneak in some time to process these shots.</p>

      <p>Over the last few months, I have re-discovered some unix commands (it&rsquo;s been such a long time)
 Eliminate duplicate lines from a file   #sort -u filename &gt; filename.new
  List all lines that do not match a condition   #grep -v ajsk filename
  Copy contents of two files to one   #cat file1 file2 &gt; file3
  Append output of a command to a file   #cat file1 &gt;&gt; file2</p>

      <p>Finally it&rsquo;s out in the open. The ultimate weapon in Google&rsquo;s powerchest to combat desktop applications, render the need for a specific platform meaningless - the browser. I guess this has been in the making for the last decade, and here it is. A browser by a company that downloads pretty much most of the internet every day.
If you are still reading this, you shouldn&rsquo;t be. Get outta here and read this.</p>

      <p>Chicken Curry with Eggs served on Rice, originally uploaded by Shivanand Velmurugan.

Thank you Mr. Raghavan Iyer. This is the man, that wrote the book 660 Curries, that has initiated me into making proper Indian food. In the last month or so, since my return from my vacation to India, I have tried eating good food, and have found cooking a very rewarding activity. It helps you think more about what you want to put in your mouth and somehow, also makes you eat less!</p>
