    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2007/04/the-day-that-google-acquired-the-world">The day that google acquired the world</a></h1>

    <div id="post">
      <p>&nbsp;Philipp Lenssen, has an interesting (scary) thought about the day that <a href="http://blog.outer-court.com/archive/2007-04-14-n32.html">google acquired the world (aka internet :) ).</a> The date that he has chosen, 12 May 2017, sent a shiver up my spine. I, definitely, don't want to see the world taken over by the most efficient search engine on my birthday!! :) That would be some scary stuff to wake up too.</p>
<p>Since we are on the subject of acquisitions, <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?q=google+doubleclick&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a">google paid over $3 billion for doubleclick</a>, a company that <a href="http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2007/04/why-theres-no-doubleclick-ad-on.html">google didn't beleive in</a> when it wanted to serve ads in the first place. How ironic! You pay more than what you invested in your company, to acquire something you didn't believe in! I find that a little absurd, and you?</p>

    <div id="post">
      <p>Me and thousands of other people, continue to use wordpress, one of the leading blog management systems (sounds kewl, eh? ;) ), and proof that is it in fact leading is <a href="http://www.plagiarismtoday.com/2007/04/09/why-wordpresscom-is-virtually-spam-free/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Apparently, <a href="http://wordpress.com" target="_blank">Wordpress.com</a>, has the least spam, compared to other free blog-hosting services. The honored list of competitors, include the likes of google, myspace and AOL, each one of them goliaths! <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Mullenweg" target="_blank">Matt Mullenweg</a>, the creator of <a href="http://wordpress.org" target="_blank">Wordpress</a>, associates the success of wordpress.com spam protection to Akismet. This is something that I use now. I used spam-karma before this, which was pretty good, but with Akismet, it is almost zero-management.</p>
<p>Google, with its wonderful, spam filter on gmail, should be able to do much better, but then, comment spam is a very different ball game.</p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2007/04/recovery-from-grub-failure">Recovery from GRUB Failure</a></h1>

    <div id="post">
      <p>I have a dual-boot PC at home, which boots to OpenSUSE and Windows. After a very tiring 7 hour journey, I came home to a GRUB failure. After searching for help all over the web, I found some help <a href="http://orgs.man.ac.uk/documentation/grub/grub_3.html" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="http://orgs.man.ac.uk/documentation/grub/grub_12.html#SEC38" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="http://orgs.man.ac.uk/documentation/grub/grub_4.html#SEC12" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="http://orgs.man.ac.uk/documentation/grub/grub_13.html#SEC78" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="http://www.troubleshooters.com/linux/grub/grub.htm" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://www.geocities.com/epark/linux/grub-w2k-HOWTO.html" target="_blank">here</a>. :)</p>
<p>It turns out, that GRUB stage 2 was not being loaded. So here's what I did.</p>
<p>1. set the root partition</p>
<p>2. run GRUB setup on the MBR.</p>
<p>3. load the os using chainloader.</p>
<p>To set a partition as root, it is required to know the device where the root partition resides. This can be found using the following command</p>
<p><code>grub&gt; find /boot/grub/stage1<br />
grub&gt; root (hd0,0)<br />
grub&gt; setup (hd0,0)<br />
grub&gt;chainloader +1</code></p>
<p>This got my system back to normal. I'm wondering where I can get some more information about GRUB, I don't understand GRUB much and would like to change that. Links to tutorials anyone?!</p>
<p>Update: Since there is hardly any audience that read my blog, it's only fair that I stop asking questions.. :) So here are some links that I found</p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2007/03/blogging-from-a-linux-desktop">Blogging from a linux desktop</a></h1>

    <div id="post">
      <p>Yipeee!! Just one word - Fantabulous.</p>
<p>The most painless install ever. Well, actually, I haven't yet completely migrated to Ubuntu, but I just might. Today, I downloaded the <a href="http://http://www.ubuntu.com/news/Ubuntu704Beta" target="_blank">latest beta of Ubuntu</a> codenamed"Feisty Fawn". The thing that amazed me was that it had to use a restricted driver to get my Wireless working, but it did detected it and also most other hardware on my laptop. Amazing how far linux has come in the last couple of years. No wonder, Ubuntu has captured significant market-share from other linux distros. Now what is required to push wide-scale adoption, is to make a slicker interface. I know there is Gnome and KDE, but we need to rethink requirements. Greedy as I am, I fail to be satisfied by "better than windows" performance. It would be great if the Ubuntu developer push the envelope further, and develop something that can compete with MAC OSX.</p>
<p>Beagle, Banshee and Mono integration would be great. Also, I sorely miss voip functionality that skype and gtalk provide. What is my alternative? Anyone out there with a good app for voip?  A developer edition anyone?!</p>
<p>It is amazing how much a little money and the eye for perfection can achieve. Kudos to Mark shuttleworth and his millions! :). Here are some of the features of the new release:</p>
<ul>
<li>A migration-assistant, which helps you move your data from your "old" OS into Ubuntu. Read old as Windows; Wink.</li>
<li>New Games: Sudoku and Chess</li>
<li>Disk Analyzer</li>
<li>VMI enabled kernel, for improved performance when running on VMware hypervisors</li>
<li>All new artwork</li>
<li>New Graphical Desktop Effects</li>
</ul>
<p>Update: I just installed Ubuntu on my external USB drive using the QEMU processor emulator. There are several ways to run it off a USB drive.</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a vfat partition on the USB drive and install using the a special boot sequence as detailed <a href="http://www.pendrivelinux.com/2007/01/25/usb-x-ubuntu-610" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
<li>Install on the USB drive and boot using GRUB - <a href="http://frontier05.blogspot.com/2006/01/installing-ubuntu-to-external-usb.html" target="_blank">A how-to by Doug</a><a href="http://frontier05.blogspot.com/2006/01/installing-ubuntu-to-external-usb.html" target="_blank"> Ly</a>.</li>
<li>Run Ubuntu using QEMU. I went with this option, since I can switch between windows and linux without a reboot. Also, installing a small add-on , kQemu, increases the performance to almost that of a native install. There is a wonderful how-to <a href="http://www.pendrivelinux.com/2007/03/13/run-ubuntu-from-windows-via-a-portable-usb-hard-drive/" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
<li>run Ubuntu on Vmware. <a href="http://homepage.sunrise.ch/mysunrise/ekeller00/ubuntu/2a_UbuntuInWindows_VMware_e.html" target="_blank">Do you want a how-to?</a></li>
</ol>
<p>I need to have access to gtalk and skype for atleast the next few months, so that has prompted me to stick with an emulated version. I hope to move completely to Ubuntu around mid May. So let's see what happens then!</p>

      <p>I ought to resist the temptation of writing posts full of only links to other blogs .. but this one is good</p>

<p>He talks about how "selling news is dead". I thinks he hits the nail on the head with this one. When was the last time, that you read/saw, a news items that was worth buying the newspaper for?</p>
<p>I can hardly remember the time, I needed to pick a newspaper, let alone buy one. Well, I do read a couple of articles once a week, on the papers that lie around in my office reception.</p>
