    <div class="article-content">
      <p>I&rsquo;ve been busy. That doesn&rsquo;t explain my silence on this blog, its but an excuse. A lot of things have been happening, both in my personal and professional life, and I&rsquo;m not at liberty to talk about them. Those are for another day.</p>

<p>I have been writing code - for money, ie - for 9 years now. This obsession started a good 6 years before that. I don&rsquo;t have much to show for it (most of it is copyrighted, or lost across several machines, that weren&rsquo;t mine). One thing that hasn&rsquo;t changed is the burning desire to get near some of my idols &ndash; gods even. When I was 15, I promised myself that I will strive to be at the same level as some of these people.</p>

<p>Mashable made a <a href="http://mashable.com/2010/07/04/web-founding-fathers/">list of people &ndash; fathers of the internet</a>, and so did <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2010/07/04/foundersOfTheWeb.html">Dave winer</a>. All of these people have made such great contributions, that it is foolish to not agree with both these lists. However, for me, as a hacker, they interest me less than those who were the developers of software that made the Internet possible. Here is my non-exhaustive list, in no particular order, of the gods I try to emulate, and someday match and surpass (what are we, without lofty goals, eh?)</p>

<ul>
<li>Ken Thompson<br /></li>
<li>rob pike<br /></li>
<li>stroustroup<br /></li>
<li>guido van rossum<br /></li>
<li>Linus torvalds<br /></li>
<li>Dave winer<br /></li>
<li>jwz<br /></li>
<li>Joshua bloch<br /></li>
<li>David Heinemeier Hansson<br /></li>
<li>james gosling<br /></li>
<li>miguel de icaza</li>
</ul>

<p>And some friends, that are equally important to me as hackers (not the kind that break into your computer)<br />
- ganesh CS<br />
- Yuvi panda<br />
- guru<br />
- rajasekar</p>

<p>(There are couple who I work with, that should be on that list, but I still have to work with them, and don&rsquo;t want to make anyone jealous. Sorry for leaving you out guys/gals ;) )</p>

<p>If you are a hacker or want to be one, you should look at this list, and pick a few, and engross yourself in their work. That is by far, the best way to get better at what you do. The first step in becoming good, is to find a measuring stick. If anyone from the list is what you measure yourself by, you are bound for greatness. See ya there!<br />
