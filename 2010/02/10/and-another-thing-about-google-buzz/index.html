  <h1 class="post-title">And another thing about Google Buzz</h1>
  <span class="post-date">Wed, Feb 10, 2010</span>
  <p>There are several issues that people have uncovered in the last 2 days that it has existed. For me, of all the features that Buzz lacks, one thing really stands out. There is no way to just see a <strong>list of the conversations</strong> (without the whole list of comments expanded by default). This is the main reason that I <strong>*had*</strong> to unfollow Scoble, Michael Arrington, Louis Gray and a bunch of others. Take a look at <a href="http://www.google.com/buzz/scobleizer/NE7yRrwbhbH/This-is-already-WAY-BETTER-than-FriendFeed-Why-Not">this conversation</a>, and you would understand why.</p>

<p>Every time, anyone, replied to that thread (which incidently has been at the top of scoble&rsquo;s buzz list all day), it would become the top post on my buzz view as well.  Now you are thinking, &ldquo;Well, Buzz was not meant for long conversations&rdquo;. Go back and read the comments on that conversation .. all 350+ of them, and come back here.</p>

<p><strong>Note to Google Buzz Developers:</strong> Now that truly sucks, and is such a trivial use-case that I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if it gets fixed in a day or two &hellip; it better if you want Scoble to continue to use it (and we all know how vital that is for any social network&rsquo;s success).</p>

<p>So here&rsquo;s my humble request: PLEASE LET ME MINIMIZE HUGE-ASS THREADS</p>

<p>Google has already done this with Google Reader, where you can just see a list of items, or see them expanded. I don&rsquo;t see any reason why this wasn&rsquo;t the case, out of the box, for Buzz. In end, the only conclusion that I can think of is that, this pre-pre-alpha from a user experience perspective, and somehow all the design gurus (the ones who kept the Google page clean all these years), have disappeared into the user.</p>

<p>Google Buzz is by far, the clumsiest google product, with almost zero forethought to how users, will use it. It&rsquo;s almost as if, none of the enigneers/designers on the Buzz have ever used twitter or facebook or friendfeed. Somehow I find that hard to believe. I&rsquo;m hoping they&rsquo;ll fix some, if not all the usability issues very soon.</p>

<p>Iterate guys! Iterate! Fast and hard.</p>
