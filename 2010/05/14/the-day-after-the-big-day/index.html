      <p>I turned 30 yesterday.</p>

<p>A whole day has passed since I left my 20s. They say it is a big day. They say it is a dreaded day. It was neither. Just busy (which is good).</p>

<p>I chanced upon [Douglas Adams&rsquo; post][1] from 1999:</p>

<p>&gt; 1. everything that&rsquo;s already in the world when you&rsquo;re born is just normal;<br />
&gt; 2. anything that gets invented between then and before you turn thirty is incredibly exciting and creative and with any luck you can make a career out of it;<br />
&gt; 3. anything that gets invented after you&rsquo;re thirty is against the natural order of things and the beginning of the end of civilisation as we know it until it&rsquo;s been around for about ten years when it gradually turns out to be alright really.<br />
&gt; Apply this list to movies, rock music, word processors and mobile phones to work out how old you are.</p>

<p>For me, Point 3 is intensely scary. I have lived all my life being on the bleeding edge (as much as I could afford, atleast). I&rsquo;ve always been in constant search of tools and technology that will make every living moment better than the one before. It has been an affliction, but one that I have throughly enjoyed, and internalised even!</p>

<p>I hope that I continue to do that for the next decade (and prove Douglas Adams&rsquo; wrong). A few posts ago, I took a partly political stand against the [ipad][3], and decided to not vote for it with my wallet. I have also been [vocal][2], about my distaste with Apple&rsquo;s lock-down of the app deployment on the iphone and ipad. In the last few weeks, I&rsquo;m starting to question myself. Maybe it is an effect of #3, as DNA pointed out. But then, this is could just be my way out, a way to weasel from [the stand][2] I took ;)</p>
