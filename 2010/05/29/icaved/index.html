  <p>I did it. I <a href="http://blog.shiv.me/2010/02/03/i-too-have-something-to-say-about-the-ipad.html">said</a> <a href="http://blog.shiv.me/2010/02/04/ipad-is-ibad-petition.html">I</a> <a href="http://blog.shiv.me/2010/03/16/so-long-and-thanks-for-the-jailed-iphone.html">wouldn&rsquo;t</a>. I said I will hold out for purely <a href="http://blog.shiv.me/2010/02/03/i-too-have-something-to-say-about-the-ipad.html">ethical reasons</a>, but it is <a href="http://twitter.com/shiva/status/14946052410">very hard to resist the iPad</a>. The first impression in-store is simply &ndash; awesome. This of course is not a surprise and is something that one can expect from apple these days.</p>

<p>Warning: This is a long post ..</p>

<p>Here are some thoughts, after a day of use:</p>

<ol>
<li>It&rsquo;s fast. Much faster than the iPhone 3GS. This is good news for the upcoming iPhone.</li>
<li>The battery lasts a really long time. It was around 80% and I used it for incessantly until it died <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> hours later. The a4 processor is at this point THE chip to kill for. If you have any samsung shares, I would dump them now, and load up on apple (although they are a tad <a href="http://www.google.com/finance?q=aapl">pricy</a> these days)</li>
<li>iPhone apps are useless and look ugly on the iPad. Don&rsquo;t bother synching any of them</li>
<li>The keyboard is a lot more usable that I thought it would be. I&rsquo;m typing this post at about 60-70% of my usual typing speed. (Only true if inclined at an proper angle &ndash; the perfect angle: the one you get with the iPad case).</li>
<li>I missed the universal back button. I&rsquo;ve been spoiled by the <a href="http://blog.shiv.me/2010/03/16/so-long-and-thanks-for-the-jailed-iphone.html">freedom-toting nexus one robot</a> ;)</li>
<li>Other small annoyances include URL copy pasting between apps, and how the app store lists apps. Exiting the app store every time I install an app is also mind-numbing. I know I can use a Mac and install all apps at one go, but I didn&rsquo;t spend a 1000 dollars for workarounds.</li>
<li>Although I could type very well, creating a blog post is not this device&rsquo;s forte. For one, all the switching back and forth, is a nightmare, and there is simply no way to get the links to apps for instance from the ipad. Adding images is a pain as well (which is why this is a purely text-only post). It is really nice until you want to go beyond its function as a consumption device. Even a little, and it makes you want to get to a mac/pc in a hurry.</li>
<li>Some apps are just stellar, that make it worthwhile go through the above mentioned niggles.</li>
</ol>

<p>I don&rsquo;t feel any remorse at having bought it, but at the same time, I&rsquo;m not floored by everything either. That is actually the strength of the device. It is the first time a computing device completely disappears and you interact with data. The experience depends on the app that you are using. Instapaper does a great job, so does the gmail web app.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not a fan of the drop list widget though. This is the one interface element that gets in the way, and frankly, I&rsquo;m surprised that this got through the apple ui designers. A sliding in from left/right would have been a better option.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a little cautious about buying a lot of apps like I did for the iPhone and then quitting the platform although I don&rsquo;t see that happening with the iPad, there is no competition in sight for at least another 18 months, and even then it would take an androId tablet a year to get to this level of refinement (if they ever do)</p>

<p>If you are a still here, here are some must have apps. Most of them are free, so get &lsquo;em now:</p>

<li>(bonus) put icons for all the google apps you use on the home screen. The web versions are really good.</li>
<li>(Ok. I&rsquo;ll stop with this) [Dropbox][15]</li>
