    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2007/11/what-will-happen-in-100-years">What will happen in 100 years?</a></h1>

    <div id="post">
      <p>That is a very difficult question to answer (which I don't answer anywhere in this post: go away). Anyone who attempts to do so, must be a genius or a fool, perhaps a little of both. <a href="http://blogoscoped.com/google-blog.html">Philipp Lenssen</a> on <a href="http://blogoscoped.com/">Google Blogoscoped</a>, observes how one of those is true. Here is a more detailed analysis.</p>
<p><img src="/images/3836395_b29aee123a.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>John Watkins, must have been quite a visionary considering the depth of his predictions and how much of it has come true.</p>
<p><strong>Five hundred Million people</strong></p>
<p>He was right about that, but under-estimated the human ability and eagerness to reproduce (and migrate). Based on the <a href="http://www.census.gov/main/www/popclock.html">US census 2000</a>,Â  the US now has over 300 million inhabitants (that is excluding all the people on H, L and BÂ Visas)</p>
<p><strong>The American will be taller</strong></p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.halls.md/on/men-height-o.htm">this website</a>, the average height of the American male is somewhere between 160 to 180 cms. Now, since he hasn't provided a figure, there is no way to validate this information.</p>
<p><strong>There will be no C, X or Q</strong></p>
<p>Hmm.. I did a few searches for words starting with C:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.findtheword.info/resultat.php?stype=begins&amp;sword=C">findtheword.info</a> = 47831</p>
<p><a href="http://wordhut.com/browse/c/1.htm">wordhut.com</a> = 274 pages of 51 words each (13974)</p>
<p>Needless to say, these are just ones that start with one of the letters he mentions. It ain't happening anytime soon.</p>
<p><strong>Hot and Cold Air from Spigots</strong></p>
<p>A <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=home+heating+systems&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a">search for 'home heating systems'</a> on google gave about 33 million results in 0.15 seconds. Thankfully, we are way ahead of what someone a hundred years ago could imagine, how we would heat ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>No mosquitoes or flies</strong></p>
<p>Not much of a change there (although, if you are reading this, then you probably live in a place will lesser mosquitoes than 100 years back)</p>
<p>One thing, I bet he never, in his wildest dreams, would have conceived was that we will have patents for <a href="http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/5733552-description.html">mosquito repellents</a></p>
<p><strong>Ready-cooked meals</strong></p>
<p>We have found a million ways to feed ourselves, and this includes fast-food, and packaged dinners and Martha Stewart's. Sweet Success!</p>
<p><strong>No foods will be exposed</strong></p>
<p>In the US, maybe, but there are still quite a few places in the world, where this is not erradicated (hint: take a flight to India and visit Arcot Road, Chennai, Tamil Nadu - also take life-insurance before you go (I can be your nominee - use the contact form for such purposes or <a href="http://twitter.com/shvelmur">tweet me</a>.))</p>
<p><strong>Coal will not be used for heating or cooking</strong></p>
<p>Woot! Woot! Google, good for ye. You are trying to do what someone thought of 100 years back. Go tidal power.</p>
<p><strong>There will be no street cars in our large cities</strong></p>
<p>Yeah right.</p>
<p><strong>Photographs will be telegraphed</strong></p>
<p>2 cheers here. We even went a step further and invented this thingy called the internet, and we actually <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/shvelmur">have</a> <a href="http://zooomr.com/photos/shiva">quite</a> a few <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=photo+sharing">sites</a> (about 100,000)Â out there helping us do this. (big business these days uh?)</p>
<p><strong>Trains @ 150 miles/hour</strong></p>
<p>Sadly, the US has moved away from trains and on to air-traffic in the last 100 years. The fastest train as of 1999 - the <a href="http://www.o-keating.com/hsr/metroliner.htm">Metroliner</a> reaches a maximum commercial speed of 125 mph (slower by 25 mph, dang!). But, there are several fast trains out there, that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_train">go over 300 mph</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Automobiles will be cheaper than horses</strong></p>
<p>No comment. (I am trying to negotiate a deal with a local honda dealer - P.s: You guys areÂ great!)</p>
<p><strong>Everybody will walk ten miles</strong></p>
<p>It feels like it without a car.</p>
<p><strong>To England in two days</strong></p>
<p>I found a very interesting site, that talks about <a href="http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/performance/q0152.shtml">planes, fuel efficiency and flight times</a> between New York and London.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/performance/q0152.shtml"><img src="/images/cruise-comparison.gif" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>Fight Time is the time taken by different aircrafts to fly between New York and London. Interesting to see that only two of the above are currently operational -Â the Boeing 747 and the F-15 Eagle. With the other two retired, a human being will have to sit for over 7 hours in a sealed coffin to reach London.</p>
<p><strong>There will be air-ships</strong></p>
<p>See above picture or google "aircraft" or "planes". (no link for you, lazy bum)</p>
<p><strong>Aerial War ships and forts on wheels</strong></p>
<p>We have the most unimaginative names for them, planes and tanks?! How cool is "forts on wheels"?!</p>
<p><strong>There will be no wild animals</strong></p>
<p>Well, we are almost there. I guess in another 20 to 30 years we will surely achieve this goal/vision. (Do ya see me smiling at this one?!)</p>
<p><strong>Man will see around the world</strong></p>
<p>He was talking about google's sight-seeing man!</p>
<p><strong>Telephones around the world</strong></p>
<p><strong>Grand opera will be telephoned</strong></p>
<p><strong>How children will be taught</strong></p>
<p>The will not be taught. They will be hypnotized into zombies, roaming around the world pursuing pointless objectives. That's what 100 years can do to the human race (I'm feeling itchy today)</p>
<p><strong>Store purchases by tubes</strong></p>
<p><strong>Vegetables grown by electricity</strong></p>
<p><strong>Oranges will grow in Philadelphia</strong></p>
<p><strong>Strawberries as large as apples</strong></p>
<p><strong>Peas as large as beets</strong></p>
<p><strong>Black, Blue and Green Roses</strong></p>
<p>What's with the predictions about food and flowers?! We have delegated these activities to the faceless farmer. (I haven't seen one in years). For all I know, the food that I eat is being grown in mars, and arrives on my table through a disruption in the sub-space continuum.</p>
<p><strong>Few drugs will be swallowed</strong></p>
<p>Nada on this one. Sorry. We have invented so many more drugs that we humans continue to swallow pills at an incredible pace. We even have new <a href="http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/5643204-description.html">patents on pill swallowing</a>.</p>

    <div id="post">
      <p>I recently got myself a Canon 40D. After a 3 year wait, I can finally afford to buy myself a DSLR, and have been going crazy with it for the last couple of weeks.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.zooomr.com/photos/shiva/3534868/"><img src="/images/3534868_87dae6bac0.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://static.zooomr.com/images/3534868_87dae6bac0_b.jpg">larger version.</a></p>
<p>Largely influenced by <a href="http://thomashawk.com/">Thomas Hawk's</a> <a href="http://thomashawk.com/2007/09/principles-and-guidelines-for-modern.html">passion</a>, I have started carrying the camera everywhere I go: to work, when I go shopping, and even when I am just walking around the neighbourhood. I shot this picture, on my back from work, last Friday. With all the shooting, I am running out of HDD space very quickly. I am ok, for the next month (I have 2 external 80GB HDD + around 60GB in my laptop). After that, I will need to move the old ones to DVDs (something, which I hate doing: easy to lose shots, and difficult to retrieve).</p>
<p>Any suggestions are welcome (If anyone is reading this!). Oh.. I almost forgot,</p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2007/10/sting-by-a-bee">Sting by a bee</a></h1>

    <div id="post">
      <p>Dang! I got stung today, by a bee,&nbsp;for the first time in my life. The little critter was trying to sniff some aroma from the back of my head, and I reached out with my hand, grabbed him (sorry, it must of hurt), and he got pissed and wanked me. Just as any normal, crazed-out geek would do, the first thing I did was to <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?q=remedy+bee+sting&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a">search the net</a> for home-grown, bee sting remedies and I found <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2088863/">this</a>&nbsp;post by William Brantley. Being a much braver individual than I can be (when it comes to bee stings), he went through a series of bee-biting to test various remedies, that exists in the market-place and several home-grown remedies. </p>
<blockquote><p>So, how did the home remedies stack up against the pharmaceutical offerings? It depends on the home, I guess. The worst home remedies were worse than the worst pharmaceuticals, and the best home remedies better than the best pharmaceuticals. The Caladryl was the sole pharmaceutical remedy I'd use again. If I had to leave the house to go get it, though, I'd buy the meat tenderizer instead and use it in the vinegar/baking soda paste. Yet why bother with either of those when you already use, on a daily basis, the two best bee sting remedies? The winners<strong>: toothpaste and ice.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am going to test the above two, and let you know the results. I am hoping that they work their magic. Oooo.. that hurts! and again! </p>
<p>Update: I don't know about the toothpaste, but the ice definitely works!! I can't feel my&nbsp;finger (forget the sting), after icing it for 30 mins. </p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2007/10/banking-woes">Banking woes</a></h1>

    <div id="post">
      <p>First off, this is a rant. You have been warned.</p>
<p>I have been banking with ICICI bank for the last 6 years. I have generally had a pleasant experience banking with them, since you could do pretty much everything you want to do with your account through their online interface. With my recent move to Canada, I was pleased to see an branch here in Vancouver.</p>
<p>I opened an account with them last week, and had used a check to make the initial deposit. A week passed and with no sign of a confirmation of account activation, I called their call center.</p>
<p><strong>Call 1:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Customer care executive(CCE): Good morning, ICICI bank, how may I help you?<br />
Me: Hi, I'm Shivanand and I opened an account with you last week. I see that my cheque has been cleared, and I haven't received any confirmation of the same. I would like to know the status of my application?<br />
CCE: Can you give me your First Name, Last Name and Phone No?<br />
Me: &lt;I give them the info&gt;<br />
CCE: I'm sorry I am unable to see a record of your account. Do you have your Customer Identification No?<br />
Me: I don't. I will call you back</p></blockquote>
<p>I had left all the documents at home, and had to call the next day.</p>
<p><strong>Call 2:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Me: &lt;I give him, my First Name, Last Name, Cust ID, my dog's name, and the exact dimensions of the turd left by my dog yesterday, in the park)<br />
Cust ID: I am sorry, I can't find your account. Can I take a request from you, to send a request to ask for information from your branch?<br />
Me: umm... what? Whatever, how long will it take to know the status of my application?<br />
Cust Id&lt;in a very loud voice&gt;: I can send a request to my back office, and it will take 2 days.<br />
Me:Why?<br />
Cust Id&lt;in a very loud voice&gt;: I have to send it to my back office and it will take 2 days.<br />
Me: Why? I called the local bank, why can't you just forward me to the local branch, and I will ask them?<br />
Cust ID: We don't have that information?<br />
Me: whatever.. &lt;and I put the phone down&gt;</p></blockquote>
<p>With billions of dollars worth of technology, in the banking systems in the world, banks can't afford to forward a call to a specific branch, to ask for a some information? I find that absurd, and downright stupid. I am trying to give you business and the first experience I get is inability to tell me why you've taken my money, but not activated my account?! If such is the level of incompetence, how well can you take care of my money?!!</p>
<p>Well, being fed up with call centers, I decided to call the branch itself. I called in, using the branch's number, and someone at the branch picked it up. She got my Cust ID, and my phone number, and said, she will call me in half hour. End of call and I am actually happy that I got the thing moving! That was simple, wasn't it? I spent 2 minutes, and got more confidence than a 20 minute conversation with a call center employee, who just doesn't care enough about the customer.</p>
<p>I also sent, this mail to ICICI customer care.</p>
<blockquote><p>Hi,<br />
I recently opened an account with ICICI bank Canada (I have been a ICICI bank customer for the last 6 years in India) and have not received confirmation of account activation. I tried calling your call center and was faced with a shouting employee. I found like to refrain from mentioning the person by name. Please educate your call center employees, that as a customer, I have not interest in the limitations that you have in your back office.<br />
I gave the employee my First name, last name and my customer identification number, and all he could give me was that my account was not active. (which is why I was calling). Also, remember this is after ICICI bank had withdrawn $5000 from my account (I gave a cheque for the initial deposit) a week back. I think it would be best if you can sensitize your employees on the ethics of phone conversation and also try and provide a solution rather than try and get rid of the call.<br />
I usually make it public, when I rant about something and have posted this mail on my blog. Click on the link below. I would expect a response from you, either through mail, or on my website.<br />
