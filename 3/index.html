        <span class="post-date">Sun, Aug 28, 2011</span>
        <p>A friend asked what I like about google+, and as I started posting a reply , I noticed there were enough to make a blog post. So here goes&hellip;</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a quick list:<br />
1. Mobile app on android and iphone are awesome!<br />
2. Automatic upload of pics on phone/picasa<br />
3. Non-crappy photos (allows 2400+px, and g+ renders pictures better, since they don&rsquo;t mess with the image, if it is smaller than the max size)<br />
4. Easier to mention specific people in a conversation. (auto-completes ppl&rsquo;s profile name)<br />
5. hangouts (free video conferencing)<br />
6. Group messaging done right (huddle) on the mobile phone<br />
7. decent integration with email (I guess this is just coz I use Gmail)<br />
8. Privacy - predictable and manageable (not that it matters to me)<br />
9. Much less noise (a - mostly used by techies for now, b - allows asymmetric relationships Ã  la twitter)<br />
10. Keyboard shortcuts (J, K work. Someone at google like vi &ndash; a lot)</p>

<p>So, there&rsquo;s 10 reasons to dump Facebook for G+. There is a lot more in terms of features (new ones are added all the time), but mostly the community is awesome, and the engagement is better!</p>

<p>11. (bonus). I was going to say games, but they have that here too, but I&rsquo;m not bothered by it, and don&rsquo;t have to see someone&rsquo;s update on buying sheep</p>

<p>Having said the above, I miss a couple of FB &ldquo;features&rdquo;. Really, its the of the same: 1. There is no way to start a conversation with someone, unless, you address it specifically to that person (in which case nobody else see it). Facebook does this simply, by providing a &ldquo;wall&rdquo;.</p>

<p>2. There are no &ldquo;Groups&rdquo;. Ie each circle is local to me, and hence, if I want to have a group for all my friends from university, I will have to add them to a circle. In order to simulate Facebook &ldquo;groups&rdquo;, everyone in that circle, has to add everyone else to a group of the same name. Adding one more person to that group, now means that everyone has to add that person manually.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure, google will come up with something to address the above two. We&rsquo;ll have to wait and see how it goes!</p>

        <p>If you write a lot of scripts to automate tasks, you probably already know this. However, if you don&rsquo;t, and you are still reading, you are probably a programmer, in which case, you really should be learning how to script in BASH!</p>

<p>A couple of pointers for you:<br />
1. Using a -x, in the shebang line &ldquo;echo&rdquo;s every line before executing. This turns out to be quite useful for debugging shell scripts<br />
2. It&rsquo;s quite easy to make BASH print a countdown.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Sun, Jul 24, 2011</span>
        <p>A couple of weeks ago I started a new project - to shoot random strangers in the streets of GVRD (Greater Vancouver Regional Districts - for those of you that are not from here). I wanted to see if I had the guts to walk up to random strangers, and ask their permission to shoot a picture of them. I was also curious to know how they would react to it, and what my success rate would be.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve asked around 14, and 8 said yes. Some of them were not comfortable with their pictures on the internets. I offered them 3 options.</p>

<ol>
<li>Pictures don&rsquo;t end up on the internet (emailed to them if they send me an email)</li>
<li>On the internet for non-commercial purposes.</li>
<li>On the internet in public domain.</li>
</ol>

<p>Only 2 were ok with public domain. The rest opted for option 2. One didn&rsquo;t want it on the internet at all.</p>

<p>It was an interesting experience, and I&rsquo;m looking forward to more such excursions. For the lack of a better name, I chose to call this project : <a href="http://blog.shiv.me/projects/people-of-gvrd/">People of GVRD</a>.</p>

<p>Suggestions are welcome. Do you have a better name for the project? Perhaps, thoughts on how I should approach people. Do you think I&rsquo;m insane? Apart from photos, would you be interested in a short blurb about the person? What would you like to know?</p>

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Jul 23, 2011</span>
        <p>Just upgraded to OSX Lion. A very slick interface.</p>

<p>Quick Review:</p>

<p>1. Launchpad. Solved previously by Alfred in the GUI, and bash aliases on the command line.</p>

<p>2. Mission Control. Eye-candy. Will probably use it until I get tired of all the moving windows, and stick to Cmd+arrow keys to switch desktops. Maybe normal users will find it useful. But then, most people don&rsquo;t want anything that increases their workflow complexity. Most of them have trouble keeping track of more than a couple of windows, let alone, 10s of them (which I think is what features like Mission Control will promote)</p>

<p>3. I&rsquo;ll probably never use gestures (keyboard shortcuts solved that probably elegantly, some 40 years ago).</p>

<p>4. First real annoyance: the default mouse-axis configuration is inverted. I don&rsquo;t get why this was changed?! (refer image)</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s way too late to go into other cool and annoying things. I&rsquo;m not sure how I really feel about Lauchpad. Maybe it&rsquo;s not a bad idea to have a full screen view of all the apps - ipad style.</p>

<p>P.S: Until I figure out how to get all of my posts on Google+ as full content, I&rsquo;m going to double post them.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Tue, Jun 21, 2011</span>
        <p>In *nix systems, you can make the display, the GUI of an application, appear on another machine.  This if often required, when the machine you want to run the application on is in a lab, and you have access through a desktop machine that has a monitor.</p>

<p>You can do this, by running an XServer on the desktop machine and configuring the client (the one where you run your app) with the XServer details. By default, the XServer instance on your desktop disallows communication from all machines except localhost. Thus, you will need to add the host in the allowed list using the xhost command.</p>

<p><strong>On your machine</strong>,  to disable security checks:</p>

<p><code>$ xhost +</code></p>

<p>To allow connections from a single  host:</p>

<p><code>$ xhost +&lt;hostname/ip&gt;</code></p>

<p><strong>On the client machine</strong> where the application is run, set the X Server to display to (for bash shell):</p>

<p><code>$ export DISPLAY=&lt;hostname&gt;:&lt;displaynumber&gt;.&lt;screennumber&gt;</code></p>

<p>If you haven&rsquo;t changed the display-number or screen-number :</p>

<p><code>$ export DISPLAY=&lt;hostname&gt;:0.0</code></p>

        <span class="post-date">Sun, May 1, 2011</span>
        <p><a href="http://blog.shiv.me/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/20110501-112322.jpg"><img src="/images/20110501-112322.jpg" alt="20110501-112322.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been a year since I <a href="http://blog.shiv.me/2010/05/29/icaved.html">sold my kidneys for an iPad</a>. It&rsquo;s been fun. It has replaced every other device I own (ie, a couple of PCs and the nexus one). It&rsquo;s an outright winner, when it comes to reading, especially long-form articles, and books alike. It has become my go-to machine for everyday news, twitter/facebook, and even for browsing my favorite photographers.</p>

<p>It have however remained strictly in the realm of content consumption &ndash; until now. In the last few days, I&rsquo;ve added a stylus - the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ZSHKIY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=shivanand-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399349&amp;creativeASIN=B003ZSHKIY">Targus iPad stylus</a> (available quite readily at most &lsquo;best-buy&rsquo;s, and on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ZSHKIY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=shivanand-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399349&amp;creativeASIN=B003ZSHKIY">Amazon</a>), and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003K1EYM6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=keepinintouch-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399353&amp;creativeASIN=B003K1EYM6">iPad&rsquo;s camera connect kit</a>. If you own an iPad (v1 or v2) I would recommend that you fork out the moolah for these two. It will be the best $50 you&rsquo;ll ever spend on accessories for the iPad. Forget the cool looking <a href="http://store.apple.com/us/product/MC942?mco=MTM3NjE5ODE">smart cover</a>. These will be more rewarding than the 2 hours of thrill of watching the smart cover turn off the ipad when you close it.</p>

<p>The targus stylus is without doubt the best one in the market yet. It&rsquo;s got good heft to it. Feels comfortable to hold. The only gripe I have with the Targus is the length. I can&rsquo;t but wonder why they didn&rsquo;t make it same as a standard pencil.</p>

<p>There is no contest between this, and the <a href="http://tenonedesign.com/sketch.php">Pogo Sketch</a>. (Ten-one design could be the next Wacom, if they get their [][6]<a href="http://thetechjournal.com/electronics/tablet/pressure-sensitive-drawing-headed-to-ipad.xhtml">pressure sensitive stylus</a> right. Wacom should buy them out, now, before they get too big). The targus has an air-filled bubble for the tip, which slides with less resistance against the iPad&rsquo;s screen, than the spongy one of the pogo sketch. The tip is still fairly large, and the level of control you get varies by the app. If you use [][7]<a href="itms-apps://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/penultimate/id354098826?mt=8">Penultimate</a>, this stylus will provide much better control. The iPad can now actually replace paper &amp; pen (somewhat). I can&rsquo;t wait to see how good the <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2011/04/wacom-stylus-for-ipad-is-not-what-youre-hoping-for/">Wacom</a> <a href="http://www.geeky-gadgets.com/wacom-ipad-stylus-looks-ugly-but-works-beautiful-18-04-2011/">stylus</a> <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-31747_7-20055024-243.html">is going to be</a>. It will definitely cost more (around $40 if I&rsquo;m right), but for $20, this is the best stylus (that is also readily available) right now.</p>

<p>The camera connect kit, is a thing of marvel. It is not like Apple to allow such a wide range of applications for a single piece of plastic (even if it is over-priced for something that should be part of the iPad purchase). I just found out that it works quite well with my camera (a Canon 7D). Importing RAW images onto the iPad are faster than importing them on my MacbookPro (something seriously out-of-whack here &ndash; I&rsquo;ll need to investigate, to confirm this). It also allows connecting any &ldquo;Mac&rdquo; supported keyboard (I&rsquo;m typing this post on my logitech USB Wave keyboard, which I must say kicks the pants off any keyboard Apple currently sells). Of course, carrying a keyboard around is out of question, but it&rsquo;s nice to know it works without any special drivers.</p>

<p><strong>Tip</strong>: Both <em>Ctrl+shift+arrows</em> (begin/end of line), and <em>Cmd+shift+arrows</em> (1-word at a time) allow you to select text on iPad. of course, you can navigate around the text, if you don&rsquo;t use shift. No, someone needs to port vim to iOS. That would be awesome.</p>

<p>The killer combo of the week, was a little hard to choose. Here are two:</p>

<ul>
<li>Targus Stylus + Penultimate</li>
<li>Blogsy + iPad Camera connect kit + Logitech Wave keyboard</li>
</ul>

<p>[][11][Photosmith][11] looks like a promising app. Currently, it is metadata management and import app, that syncs with Lightroom via Wifi. $20 is quite reasonable for an app that will allow automatic import into lightroom. However, I&rsquo;m unconvinced with the design. I wish they would provide better selection capabilities. I&rsquo;d buy it in a heartbeat, if they allowed multi-select+tagging or some kind of paint interface that can apply a group of tag+collection info that I define.</p>

        <p>And now you&rsquo;ve done it!! Bah! I thought it was so cool that I could plot of heat map of my location for a full year. With <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2011/04/iphone-customers-lawsuit-data/">all</a> <a href="http://gigaom.com/2011/04/21/researcher-iphone-location-data-already-used-by-cops/">the</a> [cribbing][2] around the internets about how the iphone is not secure because it stores data (ie a cache of your location data), Apple has decided to squash this wonderful &ldquo;easter egg&rdquo;.
&gt;
&gt; Sometime in the next few weeks Apple will release a free iOS software update that:
&gt;
&gt; reduces the size of the crowd-sourced Wi-Fi hotspot and cell tower database cached on the iPhone,<br />
&gt; ceases backing up this cache, and<br />
&gt; deletes this cache entirely when Location Services is turned off.<br />
&gt; In the next major iOS software release the cache will also be encrypted on the iPhone.
&gt;</p>

<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be cool, if someone actually wrote an app that does the exact same thing? I bet it would sell like crazy! I&rsquo;d buy it.</p>

        <p>This is a test post from <a href="http://blogsyapp.com/">blogsy</a>, an iPad blogging tool.</p>

<p>The interface design looks thoughtful &ndash; drag &amp; drop of images from flickr and picasa, videos from YouTube, a built it google search and browser to get at other content. Although there is a bit of a learning curve, it makes the iPad a true content generation device.</p>

<p>Maybe this will keep me blogging this time around. On that note, here&rsquo;s a cutie pie to bring a smile to you, today.</p>

<p>Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are,&ndash;</p>

<p>To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.</p>

        <p>If you weren&rsquo;t in a hole the past few days, you would have heard about the iPad 2 launch. Here&rsquo;s Conan&rsquo;s take on it.</p>

<p>I must say, the cover is a thing of engineering beauty. Kudos on that, Apple, and thanks for screwing over several thousands of your iPad 1 customers, who forked up 9.5 Billion in revenue in 9 months.</p>

<p>Every year, I either chance upon something new, or remind myself of something interesting that I&rsquo;ve forgotten. This is the latter case. On a *NIX shell, you can push a foreground process to background (obviously without terminating it):</p>

<p><code>
$ ./someprocess  
...  
...  
...  
Ctrl-Z  
[1]+ Stopped   ./someprocess  
$ bg  
[1]+ ./someprocess &amp;</code></p>

<p>To bring the process into foreground:</p>

<p><code>
$ fg     &lt; -- last process pushed into bkgnd  
$ jobs   [1] ./someprocess  
[2] ./someotherprocess  
$ fg 2  
</code></p>

        <p>Some actors have the incredible talent of keen observation, and Mr Spacey is a master at it. Watch him channeling Pacino around 5:25. In few words, he makes you believe you&rsquo;re seeing the real Pacino. The &lsquo;Christopher Walken&rsquo; is also spot on.</p>

        <p>DMU (Delete me Uncensored) is a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/censorshipsucks/">group on Flickr</a>, that was formed because a few people got pissed at Flickr censoring content. It is a very &ldquo;lively&rdquo; place on most days with a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/censorshipsucks/discuss/72157625675827075/">lot </a>of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/censorshipsucks/discuss/72157625780640978/">colour </a>and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/censorshipsucks/discuss/72157625675599763/">personality</a>. Mostly its just a bunch of fine folks that have a common passion (photography), and express their opinions with almost no filters. It&rsquo;s easy to mistake the group for being too rude, but you just have to hang around to &lsquo;get it&rsquo;.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve had a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/shvelmur/sets/72157622838132162/">on-again off-again DMU addiction</a> mainly because it feels more authentic to me, mostly because I&rsquo;ve seen how serious they are about the art form, but also take themselves lightly. I chanced upon two very interesting music videos on one of the threads.</p>

<p>Phew! What an awesome 23 hours! I&rsquo;m just back from <a href="http://barcamp.org/w/page/29849528/BarCampVancouver2010">Barcamp Vancouver 2010</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23BCV10">#bcv10</a>. (Check out some <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/barcampvancouver/">pictures from the event</a>). It&rsquo;s been a while, since I have been this tired and excited at the same time. There are a thousand threads competing for the processor(s) in my head right now. I met a lot of very interesting people, and learnt about some great ideas. It has been a very educational weekend, in general. For all the great folks I met, I&rsquo;m sure there were many more that I couldn&rsquo;t chat with. To you, I say, &ldquo;<a href="http://www.google.com/profiles/shvelmur">Let&rsquo;s meet on the internets</a>&rdquo;.</p>

<p>A few great projects/ideas:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a> - Open hardware platform for very building very cool things. A very inexpensive way to build your very own robot army.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.plumtreeportfolios.com/">Plumtree Portfolios</a> - Vancouver-based wedding photographer platform. This wasn&rsquo;t a talk, but I wish it had been. A very interesting, clean product. Shawn Taylor is the founder, and he is getting geared up. This is has the potential to be huge, especially in Vancouver.</li>
<li><a href="http://johnboxall.github.com/master-class/">HTML5</a> - a great talk by John Baxall, CEO @ Mobify. One of the best talks, and a great intro into the world of feature detection on browsers.</li>
<li><a href="http://openrestaurants.org/">OpenRestaurants</a> - a vision to make restaurant websites suck less. Fingers crossed that this will happen sooner. We can all use better access to data (and not keep it behind walls .. I&rsquo;m looking at you Facebook)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mcantelon/fashion-quest">FashionQuest</a> - Text-only adventure game engine. Aahh this brought back some memories. A very interesting use of YAML (In my world, it&rsquo;s used as modelling language for NETCONF)</li>
<li><a href="http://mirametrix.com/">Freaking Eyes</a> <a href="http://jonchui.wordpress.com/2010/11/21/492/">EyePong</a>- Control an ipad app with your eyes (This stuff just blew my mind. Playing pong with just your eyes is incredible, not to mention the zillion possibilities)</li>
<li><a href="http://symphony-cms.com/">Symphony CMS</a> - an XSLT based open source wiki. Another hallway demo. If you work for a large company, and your current CMS sucks, give this a looksie.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some people that I got a chance to chat with. Friend &lsquo;em up on twitter. Check out their projects/websites. It will widen your world, and will make you think.</p>
