      <p>Rich Skrenta elucidates the power of less code.
 I ask you, grasshopper, which is better: flexible code or tiny code?
&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; you exclaim, &ldquo;Learned master, it is a trick question: code which is tiny yet flexible is best!&rdquo;
WRONG! Tiny code is always best. Now you must carry water up the hill for the rest of the day.
 For sure, he can&rsquo;t think up of good stories. Just Kidding!</p>

      <p>Over the last couple of years, the onslaught of web 2.0 apps has almost made the desktop irrelevant. With a service offering for almost every kind of application that a normal user would use, the age of installing applications is near its fag-end.
Is this good? Is this the direction we want to head towards? More importantly, does it make real sense for end-users? Ok let&rsquo;s see what you pay for a normal laptop these days.</p>

      <p>Finally upgraded to wordpress 2.2.
Geez!! It was released almost a week back and I hadn&rsquo;t upgraded!!! I know, I know! I am a little paranoid!
I wonder why, that every time I update my wordpress version, I need to go through this very laborious task, of backing up my database, the entire wordpress folder, the last underwear that I wore, etc. Scripts guys! I need a script that does all that.</p>

      <p>I&rsquo;ve been on a reading binge lately. With quite a few hours of flying time, and long waits at airport lounges, I got the chance to catch up on my reading. Went through two books this time around, the placid, but mildly interesting &ldquo;The Namesake&rdquo; by Jhumpa Lahiri (skip the book and watch the movie.. way better) and the exhilariting final masterpiece, &ldquo;The Salmon of Doubt&rdquo;, (wikipedia entry here) by the new age, space comic, Douglas Adams.</p>

      <p>And the timing is perfect. Mr Dell, as it turns out (a little Douglassy, eh? Don&rsquo;t get it, read &ldquo;Salmon of Doubt&rdquo;, the last book by Douglas Adams, pg 27), runs Ubuntu, Feisty Fawn on his home PC. Well, one of his PCs, he has four mamoths with 4GB RAM and a Quadro FX 3500 et al, costing well over $4000. Aparently, he also runs windows as well. Hmmm&hellip; living the high life.</p>
