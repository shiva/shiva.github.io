      <p>I did it. I said I wouldn&rsquo;t. I said I will hold out for purely ethical reasons, but it is very hard to resist the iPad. The first impression in-store is simply &ndash; awesome. This of course is not a surprise and is something that one can expect from apple these days.
Warning: This is a long post ..
Here are some thoughts, after a day of use:
 It&rsquo;s fast.</p>

      <p>I turned 30 yesterday.
A whole day has passed since I left my 20s. They say it is a big day. They say it is a dreaded day. It was neither. Just busy (which is good).
I chanced upon [Douglas Adams' post][1] from 1999:
&gt; 1. everything that&rsquo;s already in the world when you&rsquo;re born is just normal;
&gt; 2. anything that gets invented between then and before you turn thirty is incredibly exciting and creative and with any luck you can make a career out of it;</p>

      <p>This is a test post to see if Dave Winer&rsquo;s OPML editor works with a self-hosted wordpress blog. There is something geeky about seeing crappy fonts on a screen, that makes one want to use a tool more.
I&rsquo;ve known of the OPML editor for a few years now, and have tried several times to find a neat use-case for it in my workflow, and it never had a compelling enough reason for me to stick with it.</p>

      <p>A recent conversation about Melody Gardot, and her songs, her recovery and music therapy led to the following thoughts. It&rsquo;s some deep shit, but struck me as something that I should share. If you could care less about such things, move along, and forget that this every happened. If not, read on. It might just inspire some more thought
 Person 1: You know I&rsquo;m beginning to believe that each time something hits us hard - there&rsquo;s going to be a lovely gift - only thing you don&rsquo;t see it right away.</p>
