      <p>PHP is an incredibly easy to use scripting language and yesterday I had my first meeting with it.
Yeah, I know I support and fix some issues in wordpress, but that just requires programming knowledge, and not exactly great php exposure. But yesterday, I wrote a small tool to track some timesheet info, in php and the whole thing took about 1.5 hours to complete. Slick UI, storing and retreiving from DB et al!</p>

      <p>I have been wanting to integrate photos that I take into my Wordpress blog for over 6 months now!
I finally found the best suited solution for me. Well almost! Probably the second best thing
I can now do the following:
 Insert images from my flickr stream into my blog. Present a gallery of images based on my sets The visitor can now search images based on flickr tags</p>

      <p>I found a very interesting bug report on ubuntu! If you haven&rsquo;t heard about Ubuntu, then this bug report is definetely a must read. Check it out!
 Microsoft has a majority market share in the new desktop PC marketplace. This is a bug, which Ubuntu is designed to fix.
 Bug #1 in Ubuntu - Microsoft has a majority market share
I tried to see how the latest release of Ubuntu has addressed this particular bug, and I see that it is still pending.</p>

      <p>Yet another wondeful ride on my bike, and I&rsquo;m road wiser !!
I rode to Pondy last Friday, (the usual weekend get-away). Having been long since my bike stretched its engines, this ride was a nice change for both me and my bike.
Pitck black, it was, that night, but very little traffic on the roads. A cool breeze was working its way up my spine. Frequent drops of impending rain, threatened to drench me, my soul and my bike, as we streamed past Mahabalipuram.</p>
