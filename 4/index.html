<p>Phew! What an awesome 23 hours! I&rsquo;m just back from <a href="http://barcamp.org/w/page/29849528/BarCampVancouver2010">Barcamp Vancouver 2010</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23BCV10">#bcv10</a>. (Check out some <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/barcampvancouver/">pictures from the event</a>). It&rsquo;s been a while, since I have been this tired and excited at the same time. There are a thousand threads competing for the processor(s) in my head right now. I met a lot of very interesting people, and learnt about some great ideas. It has been a very educational weekend, in general. For all the great folks I met, I&rsquo;m sure there were many more that I couldn&rsquo;t chat with. To you, I say, &ldquo;<a href="http://www.google.com/profiles/shvelmur">Let&rsquo;s meet on the internets</a>&rdquo;.</p>

<p>A few great projects/ideas:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a> - Open hardware platform for very building very cool things. A very inexpensive way to build your very own robot army.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.plumtreeportfolios.com/">Plumtree Portfolios</a> - Vancouver-based wedding photographer platform. This wasn&rsquo;t a talk, but I wish it had been. A very interesting, clean product. Shawn Taylor is the founder, and he is getting geared up. This is has the potential to be huge, especially in Vancouver.</li>
<li><a href="http://johnboxall.github.com/master-class/">HTML5</a> - a great talk by John Baxall, CEO @ Mobify. One of the best talks, and a great intro into the world of feature detection on browsers.</li>
<li><a href="http://openrestaurants.org/">OpenRestaurants</a> - a vision to make restaurant websites suck less. Fingers crossed that this will happen sooner. We can all use better access to data (and not keep it behind walls .. I&rsquo;m looking at you Facebook)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mcantelon/fashion-quest">FashionQuest</a> - Text-only adventure game engine. Aahh this brought back some memories. A very interesting use of YAML (In my world, it&rsquo;s used as modelling language for NETCONF)</li>
<li><a href="http://mirametrix.com/">Freaking Eyes</a> <a href="http://jonchui.wordpress.com/2010/11/21/492/">EyePong</a>- Control an ipad app with your eyes (This stuff just blew my mind. Playing pong with just your eyes is incredible, not to mention the zillion possibilities)</li>
<li><a href="http://symphony-cms.com/">Symphony CMS</a> - an XSLT based open source wiki. Another hallway demo. If you work for a large company, and your current CMS sucks, give this a looksie.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some people that I got a chance to chat with. Friend &lsquo;em up on twitter. Check out their projects/websites. It will widen your world, and will make you think.</p>

        <h1 class="post-title"><a href="http://blog.shiv.me/2010/11/03/power-of-2/">Power of 2</a></h1>
        <span class="post-date">Wed, Nov 3, 2010</span>
        <p>It&rsquo;s been a while since I&rsquo;ve done anything except write code &ndash; lots of it. The last 20 days have been insane, and ofcourse to a take a break from writing code, I like to read code that others write. (You DO know that I&rsquo;m crazy, right?!). In one of my futile attempts at clearing my google-reader reading list, I chanced upon a post by <a href="http://veechand.wordpress.com/about/">Veerabahu</a>, on finding if a number is a power of 2 (or not).</p>

<p>As he writes, there is the simpleton O(n) solution (<a href="http://veechand.wordpress.com/2009/12/19/is-a-number-power-of-two/">you will have to click-through for that</a>), and the most elegant (yet) bitwise solution:</p>

<pre><code>/*
 */
bool
is_power_of_2(int n) {
   return ((n &amp; -n) == n);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The bitwise way to calculate the power of 2 is probably the most efficient in c like languages. Ofcourse for that, your language of choice needs to support it and should be more efficient that common math functions. The other way is to use some simple math.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say N, is the value, and you need to check if it is a power of two. Compute n = log N / log 2. If floor(n) == n, then N was a power of 2.</p>

<pre><code>/*
 */
bool
is_power_of_2_pure_math_baby(int n) {
    /* address -ve numbers */
    if (n &lt; 0)
        n = -n;

    double i = log(n)/log(2);      /* i = power of 2 */
    return (lower(i) == i);        /* check if perfect power of 2 */
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is obviously, a less efficient way of checking if a number is a power of 2, than using the bitwise method. However, it has a few advantages:</p>

<ol>
<li>It works exactly the same way for all values of n.</li>
<li>It works exactly the same way for all integers (ie, n can be int8/16/32/64, long, signed or unsigned, and the same logic would work</li>
<li>It is O(1) like the bitwise solution</li>
<li>It is less cryptic (ie just basic understanding of math is reqd for grokking this solution)</li>
<li>Finally, it can be extended in future to calculate if n is a power of *any value*, not just 2</li>
</ol>

<p>Of course, t<a href="http://www.artima.com/wbc/interprogP.html">he point Josh Bloch was making </a>in interviewing engineers, was that he is interested in knowing the <strong>WHY</strong> of a solution. It does not matter if the algorithm is marginally less optimal or different. If you are an interviewer in your organisation, and you catch yourself asking a question like this, remember that if an engineer can reduce O(n) to O(1), stop with similar micro-skills test. Find out why she coded it the way she did. It will tell you a lot more about her skills than some algorithms/tricks that can be picked up in a<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/047012167X?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=shivanand-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=047012167X">couple a days</a>, if not <a href="http://wiki.allegro.cc/index.php?title=Bitwise_operator#Power_of_two_check">overnight</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Thu, Sep 9, 2010</span>
        <p>to write a blog post, when someone calls you to tell you that they checked your blog, and there was nothing of interest. Ofcourse, being lazy, I just chose to put some pictures, which have been languishing in the netherworld of pictures on the internet &ndash; Picasa.</p>

<p>Looks like, Google has improved picasaweb to be almost usable. It is still void of comments, or any real social aspect. I&rsquo;m still well within the free quota, and I&rsquo;m not forking out money for yet another storage provider, until they provide a way to export all of the content that I generate in a &ldquo;parseable&rdquo; form (That&rsquo;s right, we invent words here). Anyway, I will shut up with the review of another techy thingy, and put some pictures on.</p>

        <p>Since my last post, I&rsquo;ve had a couple of replies, a few more tweets, and few minutes of talking about unsigned types in Java, and why it doesn&rsquo;t support them.</p>

<p>I still retail the view that unsigned types are unnecessary for the majority of Java developers. The only kind that should care, are those who deal with network information (like representing an ipaddress or macaddress). Everyone, put down your forks, and do not touch the unsigned.</p>

        <p>An interesting thing for me, is that if I am active on twitter during daytime in India (now that I&rsquo;m here on vacation), I get to have some interesting conversations about design and development. Today, I chanced to talk about the lack of unsigned values support in Java.</p>

<p>&ndash; <a href="http://www.quoteurl.com/2bgmt">this quote</a> was brought to you by <a href="http://www.quoteurl.com">quoteurl</a></p>

<p>Java is, by no means, a &ldquo;new&rdquo; language for anyone I know. However, we still try to write C/C++ like code using it. We approach it with all of the training of C/C++, and start micro-optimisation much before it is needed, and end up with hard to comprehend complex code.</p>

<p>I thought I will write a long-winded post about <a href="http://darksleep.com/player/JavaAndUnsignedTypes.html#why_no_unsigned_types">why unsigned int is not available in Java</a>, and <a href="http://www.javamex.com/java_equivalents/unsigned.shtml">how to emulate it if you really need to</a>, but I will leave that to more able hands.</p>

<p>The reason for lack of unsigned types in Java are:<br />
1. The core of the Java language was designed to be simple. This meant leaving out anything that adds complexity that can be done without. unsigned types didn&rsquo;t make the cut<br />
2. Someone got lazy and didn&rsquo;t bother to implement them, when the time came to make Oak into Java. (I wish leaving things out like this happen more in the industry).</p>

<p>Now, let&rsquo;s examine why one requires unsigned types:<br />
1. Represent business case values like salary or percentile etc<br />
2. Store bitsets &ndash; each bit representing some state or option<br />
3. provide the ability to store more value that one can in an signed, thereby requiring lesser in-memory size</p>

<p>Case 1 is a no brainer: As long as the value fits within the bounds of a 32-bit integer, you shouldn&rsquo;t care. Unless you need to store a value greater than 2,147,483,647, you shouldn&rsquo;t care if it is signed or unsigned.</p>

<p>Case 2 is a hack: This is a typical carry-over from the C world, where there are no true enum or bitset types. If you need this, consider using an Enum or BitSet (as the case be for the problem you are trying to address)</p>

<p>Case 3 is a delusion, and a sin: To a certain extent this is also something that was necessary and a good thing in C, and almost useless, and sometimes wrong to do in Java. The cost and the risk of implementing a type, particularly one that will require, new arithmetic semantics to be written, is never justified. The less new language syntax one invents, the simpler the code is. My rule of thumb is &ndash; if I&rsquo;m extending the language, I delete that class, and re-write it to use only existing semantics. If that means re-writing 5 other classes, so be it. In the long run, that yields a better, compact, and clean system.</p>

<p>Now contrast that, with using a signed int, where you expect the value to be unsigned. Unless you need to store a value greater than 2,147,483,647 there is no reason or benefit for implementing an unsigned int. Even in that case, unless you expect that to be marshalled to a system implemented in another language (like C/C++) via rpc, you should be using a long.</p>

<p>The next time you get the urge to extend the Java language, by defining a class that the language left out &ndash; think twice if you really need it. If, after deliberation, you still think you need it, implement it, use it in your code, delete the implementation and re-write your code. Trust me, it won&rsquo;t have affected the application much, but your code will be cleaner and simpler to understand.</p>

<p>That is worth every extra-line of non-resuable code that you write.</p>

<p>Peace.<br />

        <h1 class="post-title"><a href="http://blog.shiv.me/2010/06/02/a-list-to-be-on/">A list to be on</a></h1>
        <span class="post-date">Wed, Jun 2, 2010</span>
        <p>I&rsquo;ve been busy. That doesn&rsquo;t explain my silence on this blog, its but an excuse. A lot of things have been happening, both in my personal and professional life, and I&rsquo;m not at liberty to talk about them. Those are for another day.</p>

<p>I have been writing code - for money, ie - for 9 years now. This obsession started a good 6 years before that. I don&rsquo;t have much to show for it (most of it is copyrighted, or lost across several machines, that weren&rsquo;t mine). One thing that hasn&rsquo;t changed is the burning desire to get near some of my idols &ndash; gods even. When I was 15, I promised myself that I will strive to be at the same level as some of these people.</p>

<p>Mashable made a <a href="http://mashable.com/2010/07/04/web-founding-fathers/">list of people &ndash; fathers of the internet</a>, and so did <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2010/07/04/foundersOfTheWeb.html">Dave winer</a>. All of these people have made such great contributions, that it is foolish to not agree with both these lists. However, for me, as a hacker, they interest me less than those who were the developers of software that made the Internet possible. Here is my non-exhaustive list, in no particular order, of the gods I try to emulate, and someday match and surpass (what are we, without lofty goals, eh?)</p>

<ul>
<li>Ken Thompson<br /></li>
<li>rob pike<br /></li>
<li>stroustroup<br /></li>
<li>guido van rossum<br /></li>
<li>Linus torvalds<br /></li>
<li>Dave winer<br /></li>
<li>jwz<br /></li>
<li>Joshua bloch<br /></li>
<li>David Heinemeier Hansson<br /></li>
<li>james gosling<br /></li>
<li>miguel de icaza</li>
</ul>

<p>And some friends, that are equally important to me as hackers (not the kind that break into your computer)<br />
- ganesh CS<br />
- Yuvi panda<br />
- guru<br />
- rajasekar</p>

<p>(There are couple who I work with, that should be on that list, but I still have to work with them, and don&rsquo;t want to make anyone jealous. Sorry for leaving you out guys/gals ;) )</p>

<p>If you are a hacker or want to be one, you should look at this list, and pick a few, and engross yourself in their work. That is by far, the best way to get better at what you do. The first step in becoming good, is to find a measuring stick. If anyone from the list is what you measure yourself by, you are bound for greatness. See ya there!<br />

        <p>I did it. I <a href="http://blog.shiv.me/2010/02/03/i-too-have-something-to-say-about-the-ipad.html">said</a> <a href="http://blog.shiv.me/2010/02/04/ipad-is-ibad-petition.html">I</a> <a href="http://blog.shiv.me/2010/03/16/so-long-and-thanks-for-the-jailed-iphone.html">wouldn&rsquo;t</a>. I said I will hold out for purely <a href="http://blog.shiv.me/2010/02/03/i-too-have-something-to-say-about-the-ipad.html">ethical reasons</a>, but it is <a href="http://twitter.com/shiva/status/14946052410">very hard to resist the iPad</a>. The first impression in-store is simply &ndash; awesome. This of course is not a surprise and is something that one can expect from apple these days.</p>

<p>Warning: This is a long post ..</p>

<p>Here are some thoughts, after a day of use:</p>

<ol>
<li>It&rsquo;s fast. Much faster than the iPhone 3GS. This is good news for the upcoming iPhone.</li>
<li>The battery lasts a really long time. It was around 80% and I used it for incessantly until it died <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> hours later. The a4 processor is at this point THE chip to kill for. If you have any samsung shares, I would dump them now, and load up on apple (although they are a tad <a href="http://www.google.com/finance?q=aapl">pricy</a> these days)</li>
<li>iPhone apps are useless and look ugly on the iPad. Don&rsquo;t bother synching any of them</li>
<li>The keyboard is a lot more usable that I thought it would be. I&rsquo;m typing this post at about 60-70% of my usual typing speed. (Only true if inclined at an proper angle &ndash; the perfect angle: the one you get with the iPad case).</li>
<li>I missed the universal back button. I&rsquo;ve been spoiled by the <a href="http://blog.shiv.me/2010/03/16/so-long-and-thanks-for-the-jailed-iphone.html">freedom-toting nexus one robot</a> ;)</li>
<li>Other small annoyances include URL copy pasting between apps, and how the app store lists apps. Exiting the app store every time I install an app is also mind-numbing. I know I can use a Mac and install all apps at one go, but I didn&rsquo;t spend a 1000 dollars for workarounds.</li>
<li>Although I could type very well, creating a blog post is not this device&rsquo;s forte. For one, all the switching back and forth, is a nightmare, and there is simply no way to get the links to apps for instance from the ipad. Adding images is a pain as well (which is why this is a purely text-only post). It is really nice until you want to go beyond its function as a consumption device. Even a little, and it makes you want to get to a mac/pc in a hurry.</li>
<li>Some apps are just stellar, that make it worthwhile go through the above mentioned niggles.</li>
</ol>

<p>I don&rsquo;t feel any remorse at having bought it, but at the same time, I&rsquo;m not floored by everything either. That is actually the strength of the device. It is the first time a computing device completely disappears and you interact with data. The experience depends on the app that you are using. Instapaper does a great job, so does the gmail web app.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not a fan of the drop list widget though. This is the one interface element that gets in the way, and frankly, I&rsquo;m surprised that this got through the apple ui designers. A sliding in from left/right would have been a better option.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a little cautious about buying a lot of apps like I did for the iPhone and then quitting the platform although I don&rsquo;t see that happening with the iPad, there is no competition in sight for at least another 18 months, and even then it would take an androId tablet a year to get to this level of refinement (if they ever do)</p>

<p>If you are a still here, here are some must have apps. Most of them are free, so get &lsquo;em now:</p>

        <span class="post-date">Fri, May 14, 2010</span>
        <p>I turned 30 yesterday.</p>

<p>A whole day has passed since I left my 20s. They say it is a big day. They say it is a dreaded day. It was neither. Just busy (which is good).</p>

<p>I chanced upon [Douglas Adams&rsquo; post][1] from 1999:</p>

<p>&gt; 1. everything that&rsquo;s already in the world when you&rsquo;re born is just normal;<br />
&gt; 2. anything that gets invented between then and before you turn thirty is incredibly exciting and creative and with any luck you can make a career out of it;<br />
&gt; 3. anything that gets invented after you&rsquo;re thirty is against the natural order of things and the beginning of the end of civilisation as we know it until it&rsquo;s been around for about ten years when it gradually turns out to be alright really.<br />
&gt; Apply this list to movies, rock music, word processors and mobile phones to work out how old you are.</p>

<p>For me, Point 3 is intensely scary. I have lived all my life being on the bleeding edge (as much as I could afford, atleast). I&rsquo;ve always been in constant search of tools and technology that will make every living moment better than the one before. It has been an affliction, but one that I have throughly enjoyed, and internalised even!</p>

<p>I hope that I continue to do that for the next decade (and prove Douglas Adams&rsquo; wrong). A few posts ago, I took a partly political stand against the [ipad][3], and decided to not vote for it with my wallet. I have also been [vocal][2], about my distaste with Apple&rsquo;s lock-down of the app deployment on the iphone and ipad. In the last few weeks, I&rsquo;m starting to question myself. Maybe it is an effect of #3, as DNA pointed out. But then, this is could just be my way out, a way to weasel from [the stand][2] I took ;)</p>

        <span class="post-date">Wed, Mar 24, 2010</span>
        <p>This is a test post to see if <a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2007/02/21/daveWinerBio.html">Dave Winer</a>&rsquo;s [][1]<a href="http://editor.opml.org/">OPML editor</a> works with a []<a href="http://wordpressroot.wordpress.com/2008/08/09/writing-for-wordpress-in-the-opml-editor/">2</a>[2]<a href="http://wordpressroot.wordpress.com/2008/08/09/writing-for-wordpress-in-the-opml-editor/">self-hosted wordpress blog</a>. There is something geeky about seeing crappy fonts on a screen, that makes one want to use a tool more.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve known of the OPML editor for a few years now, and have tried several times to find a neat use-case for it in my workflow, and it never had a compelling enough reason for me to stick with it. I&rsquo;m hoping that this new wordpress editor tool will make me want to use this more.</p>

<p>This is the first post that I&rsquo;m writing using OPMLEditor, and here are some of the impressions in the first 30 minutes of use. This is by no means a thorough analysis, and is mostly off the top of my head.</p>

<p>Some cool things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Very simple elegant interface, that let&rsquo;s you focus on writing content</li>
<li>Updating an existing post, is as simple as opening a window, and starting to type. This also allows for micro-updates. As I typed this post, I save atleast 3 times. Since my blog has RSSCLoud and PubSubHubBub (sucky name), every time I hit save, you happen to be online, you will receive an update.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some annoyances:</p>

<ul>
<li>HTML markup when you decide to mark up your page. Since I&rsquo;m a geek, I guess I don&rsquo;t mind this, although I would like to be able to use my favourite markup syntax, like Markdown.</li>
<li>Non-standard menu layout =&gt; I need to search for stuff. This is pain, until I learnt the ropes a bit (all of 15 mins), and I figured out how to use it.</li>
<li>I don&rsquo;t like to take my hands of the keyboard very often, and I tend to shy away from tools that make me do it. Unfortunately, there are no default shortcuts for the simple functionality like adding a link or making something bold, etc. On the one hand, this means, that I will complete writing all that I want to write and then make it pretty. Although, I might get used to working this way, I would still be able to do most of the annotation using just the keyboard. I hope that there is someway to acheive this. I might be wrong about this, so don&rsquo;t stone me over this. ;)</li>
<li>Another really annoying thing, every time I press enter, it OPMLEditor starts a new outline, which is great for outlining, but when I try to create a list of items, it sucks &ndash; big time. For instance, see how it is horrible to view this list in the editor. If need to change one element, I will need to look at much more of the text, just to figure out where to change it.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="http://blog.shiv.me/images/user.wordPress.workspace.png" alt="Screenshot of OPMLEditor" />
* This can be solved by allowing multiple lines in the editor (using shift+enter), and ignoring those when converting to HTML.
* Images have to handle independant of the post creation. I so, wish that the OPML, can also publish the img with the post, but I think Wordpress doesn&rsquo;t provide XMLRPC API for such upload. I posted the image on this post on dropbox, which to a certain extent mitigates this issue, since all you have to do, is use something Skitch to take a screenshot and move it a public dropbox folder. Right-click the image, and you can copy the public link of that image, in finder. Another Cmd-tab, brings you back to the editing context, and few more clicks later, you have placed your image in the post. It&rsquo;s a pain, but it is better than waiting for the image to upload, etc..
* It creates tables for every item in an outline!! This is going to be a very big problem for me, since this means mixing presentation with data so much, that it will be impossible for me to parse this out later, if I just need to get the data. I don&rsquo;t understand, why what is being done using tables, can&rsquo;t be done using paragraphs instead?! This would also allow, the theme on the site to layout the data in whatever way it deems fit. I wonder if I can change this myself?</p>

        <h1 class="post-title"><a href="http://blog.shiv.me/2010/03/21/some-deep-shit/">Some deep shit</a></h1>
        <span class="post-date">Sun, Mar 21, 2010</span>
        <p>A recent conversation about <a href="http://www.melodygardot.com/">Melody Gardot</a>, and her <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melody_Gardot#Discography">songs</a>, her <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melody_Gardot#Accident">recovery and music therapy</a> led to the following thoughts. It&rsquo;s some deep shit, but struck me as something that I should share. If you could care less about such things, move along, and forget that this every happened. If not, read on. It might just inspire some more thought</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Person 1: You know I&rsquo;m beginning to believe that each time something hits us hard - there&rsquo;s going to be a lovely gift - only thing you don&rsquo;t see it right away. Takes years sometimes. If only people realise this everyone will want to have problems all the time!!</p>

<p>Person 2: What you said is true. But here&rsquo;s something to ponder. If you start believing that everything that hits you hard (or for that matter, everything) results in some unknown good, does it then even hit you as hard?! It is a wonderfully recursive mechanism, where a little bit of trust in life removes a little bit of the need to &ldquo;safeguard&rdquo; oneself, which in turn adds a little bit of trust in life.</p>

<p>Ofcourse, the minute you realize this, the whole recursive chain could unfold, and the transformation can be instantaneous. :) So it doesn&rsquo;t have to take years, one just needs to reach a critical level of trust in life or a critical level of understanding that life itself is inconsequential and therefore, the only thing of consequence is how well one can live it &ldquo;in the now&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So what do you think about that? Any comments? thoughts?! Or do you think it is just hippy shit?!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m fascinated by the beauty of Miss Gardot&rsquo;s voice, and the strength it took to get it back. Here&rsquo;s an excerpt of one of her songs, which kept me pre-occupied for a few hours late last night.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If I gave a thought to fascination I would know it wasn&rsquo;t right to care,<br />
Logic doesn&rsquo;t seem to mind that I am fascinated by the love affair,<br />
Still my heart would benefit from a little tenderness from time to time, but never mind,<br />
Cos Baby I&rsquo;m a fool who thinks it&rsquo;s cool to fall in love,<br />
Baby I should hold on just a moment and be sure it&rsquo;s not for vanity,<br />
Look me in the eye and tell me love is never based upon insanity,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thanks for the iPhone, Mr. Jobs. There is a new way to protest the iPhone. I don&rsquo;t have to <a href="http://blog.shiv.me/2010/02/04/ipad-is-ibad-petition/">sign petitions</a> anymore. I can now take my $500 <a href="http://bit.ly/cXseFC">elsewhere</a>, for a slightly more open experience. I <a href="http://blog.shiv.me/2010/02/03/i-too-have-something-to-say-about-the-ipad/">didn&rsquo;t ask for much</a>, but I don&rsquo;t have to wait on your whim any longer (no offense meant to you personally, Mr Jobs).</p>

        <h1 class="post-title"><a href="http://blog.shiv.me/2010/02/10/and-another-thing-about-google-buzz/">And another thing about Google Buzz</a></h1>
        <span class="post-date">Wed, Feb 10, 2010</span>
        <p>There are several issues that people have uncovered in the last 2 days that it has existed. For me, of all the features that Buzz lacks, one thing really stands out. There is no way to just see a <strong>list of the conversations</strong> (without the whole list of comments expanded by default). This is the main reason that I <strong>*had*</strong> to unfollow Scoble, Michael Arrington, Louis Gray and a bunch of others. Take a look at <a href="http://www.google.com/buzz/scobleizer/NE7yRrwbhbH/This-is-already-WAY-BETTER-than-FriendFeed-Why-Not">this conversation</a>, and you would understand why.</p>

<p>Every time, anyone, replied to that thread (which incidently has been at the top of scoble&rsquo;s buzz list all day), it would become the top post on my buzz view as well.  Now you are thinking, &ldquo;Well, Buzz was not meant for long conversations&rdquo;. Go back and read the comments on that conversation .. all 350+ of them, and come back here.</p>

<p><strong>Note to Google Buzz Developers:</strong> Now that truly sucks, and is such a trivial use-case that I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if it gets fixed in a day or two &hellip; it better if you want Scoble to continue to use it (and we all know how vital that is for any social network&rsquo;s success).</p>

<p>So here&rsquo;s my humble request: PLEASE LET ME MINIMIZE HUGE-ASS THREADS</p>

<p>Google has already done this with Google Reader, where you can just see a list of items, or see them expanded. I don&rsquo;t see any reason why this wasn&rsquo;t the case, out of the box, for Buzz. In end, the only conclusion that I can think of is that, this pre-pre-alpha from a user experience perspective, and somehow all the design gurus (the ones who kept the Google page clean all these years), have disappeared into the user.</p>

<p>Google Buzz is by far, the clumsiest google product, with almost zero forethought to how users, will use it. It&rsquo;s almost as if, none of the enigneers/designers on the Buzz have ever used twitter or facebook or friendfeed. Somehow I find that hard to believe. I&rsquo;m hoping they&rsquo;ll fix some, if not all the usability issues very soon.</p>

<p>Iterate guys! Iterate! Fast and hard.</p>

        <p>Did anyone else notice that buzz has an RSS feed for everything!!</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a <a href="http://www.google.com/buzz/thomashawk22/Swv6u36BGC2/Buzz-should-let-you-post-inline-images-like-you">conversation</a> that @<a href="http://www.google.com/profiles/thomashawk22#buzz">Thomashawk</a> started</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the <a href="feed://buzz.googleapis.com/feeds/104987932455782713675/comments/z12xt1zqbyjjcx44v04cdpjgjy34xxvg45k">feed for that entry</a></p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the feed for <a href="feed://buzz.googleapis.com/feeds/104987932455782713675/public/posted">the owner&rsquo;s entries</a></p>

<p>Theoretically, one could build a service that aggregates only specific conversations (and keep them updated), or only a small group etc&hellip; No more reading data from a firehose!!</p>

<p>That is very nice.</p>

<p>P.S: also this could be a way to aggregate all your webservices into one super feed, that can then be posted elsewhere (comments and all!!)</p>

<p>The power is endless, so be cautious when exercising it</p>

<p>If you think that the iPad is promoting DRM of apps that will lead computing in a direction that will undermine the freedom that we currently are enjoying, freedom the seeds of which have been sown over the last few decades, the visit the link above and sign the petition.</p>

        <p>about the iPad, or so I thought. Then I realized with every single one of them writing pages upon pages of commentary, I&rsquo;m not going to bring in too much insight. I&rsquo;ve hence, tried to curate some interesting articles that I found. You&rsquo;ve probably read most of them already, but in case you have been in a <a href="http://memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/Dilithium">di-lithium mine</a> on <a href="http://memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/Remus">Remus</a>. Yup! That&rsquo;s right, I do like Star Trek. Now do you understand why I loathe - hate - despise what has been done to the iPad!! <a href="http://memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/PADD">PADD</a>!! arrrrggghhh! serenity now! serenity now!</p>

<p>There mainly 3 kinds of responses to the iPad</p>

<p>1. grumbling about the lack of features/hardware/standards</p>

<p>2. Its v2.0 of the tablet that moses used</p>

<p>3. It&rsquo;s evil. It&rsquo;s the end of computing as we know it</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not going to bother to classify the links below into the above categories ( some overlap ).</p>

<p><a href="http://t3.dotgnu.info/">t3rmin4t0r</a>, had something interesting to say, about <a href="http://t3.dotgnu.info/misc/internet-blackout.html">censorship in Australia</a>. I think it applies quite a bit to what Apple is doing to all those who enjoy the freedom of tinkering with our computers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Any country attempting to close its internet borders in the name of censorship should be defeated, for the fear of setting a precedent. Censorship anywhere is a threat to freedom everywhere.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&rsquo;t believe <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/ipad">Apple is evil</a>. Well, at least, they are not the only company that is &ldquo;evil&rdquo;. I do know that they are a teeny bit hypocirtical.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, about the iPad .. I&rsquo;ve decided not to lease buy the iPad until</p>

<ul>
<li>There is a way other than Apple controlled store,</li>
<li>Or, Apple open-sources its OS</li>
<li>Or, Apple stops rejecting apps (any app - even the crappy kinds)</li>
</ul>

<p>I was but 4 years old when Steve Jobs said</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It appears IBM wants it all. Apple is perceived to be the only hope to offer IBM a run for its money. Dealers initially welcoming IBM with open arms now fear an IBM-dominated and -controlled future. They are increasingly turning back to Apple as the only force that can ensure their future freedom. IBM wants it all and is aiming its guns on its last obstacle to industry control: Apple. Will _Big Blue_dominate the entire computer industry? The entire information age? Was George Orwell right?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s been 25 years, and I fear that George Orwell might have been right after all!</p>

        <span class="post-date">Fri, Nov 6, 2009</span>
        <p>I&rsquo;ve lived in India for 27 of the 29 years of my life (moved to Canada in 2007) For almost every year for the last 15 years (that&rsquo;s how long I&rsquo;ve been a gadget/tech fanatic), I have lamented the availability or lack thereof of any newly released shiny thingies. Amazon has finally figured out that people outside the US, read books too. Imagine my delight when I heard that there a new version of the<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015T963C?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=shvelmurcom-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0015T963C">Kindle (The global wireless edition - no less)</a> (Disclosure: affiliate link).</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what I get when I checked to see if it available in India</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.shiv.me/images/Screen-shot-2009-11-06-at-10.37.48-PM1.png" alt="Screen shot 2009-11-06 at 10.37.48 PM" /></p>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t that amazing!! The Kindle is finally available in India!! Yay!</p>

<p>And then, I see this</p>

<p>GAAAAAAA!!! Why? Why? Why?!!!!!</p>

<p>If you are in the UK or India, you can still buy the Kindle, using the link below.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Mon, Oct 26, 2009</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2007/02/21/daveWinerBio.html">Dave Winer</a>, the inventor of RSS, wrote today about twitter&rsquo;s latest API update for supporting the <a href="http://blog.twitter.com/2009/09/soon-to-launch-lists.html">lists feature</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>It turns out there&rsquo;s an API call that retrieves the timeline for a list, and it works exactly like the API call that retrieves the timeline for an account. So much so that I didn&rsquo;t even have to change the <a href="http://listings.opml.org/verbs/apps/twitter/getTimeLine.html">glue script</a>, I pass in a <a href="http://images.scripting.com/archiveScriptingCom/2009/10/25/gluescript.gif">different URL</a> and it just worked &gt; <a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2009/10/25/goodApiDesignAtTwitter.html">orig link</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wonder if there can be a better award?! Dave Winer applauding twitter?! I never thought I&rsquo;d see the day ;) (Just kidding Dave). Dave&rsquo;s right though. There is a certain high that you get when something just works (as it was intended). That is the high that we programmers live for. It&rsquo;s like a runner&rsquo;s high.</p>

<p>It doesn&rsquo;t happen very often though. When you work on large enterprise applications where several hundred bugs invariably creep in. Decades of dragging along old code and scars from several re-designs is a norm. But, once every so often, you change a complex module, with nothing but your own understanding of how the code works (it most cases, the understanding itself is small miracle), and the change that you make, works in several of the cases at once &ndash; that moment is pure happiness. It completely makes up for all the months of slogging, and the bug-hunting</p>

<p>You cannot be a programmer, if you don&rsquo;t live for that!</p>
