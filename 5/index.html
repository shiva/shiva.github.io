<p>I&rsquo;ve been waiting for this for a while now! Gary I hope it is all that I expect it to be. If I don&rsquo;t read this the day I get it, and jump up from my bed at 2 AM crying &ldquo;crush it&rdquo; &hellip; well &hellip; I bet I will.</p>

        <p>Google street view is now available for Vancouver, Canada. So, the big G has finally realized that people living outside the US might find use for google&rsquo;s products.</p>

        <p>well not really! I just turned on <a href="http://rsscloud.org">RSSCloud</a> support on this blog&rsquo;s feed. RSSCloud allows the feedreader subscribing to you, to setup a callback address, which your blog will call whenever you publish something. If every blog does the same, it could account for several thousand, if not million CPU cycles due to lesser polling. It is the brain-child of <a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2007/02/21/daveWinerBio.html">Dave Winer</a>, the man who invented <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FRSS&amp;ei=s6mmSpDhFsWGnQe-otm_Bw&amp;usg=AFQjCNEdBSkFc9gzQ_IRDoz4mZzyuZwfbw&amp;sig2=OcpSTpcJ-ca6xlAggoL_vg">RSS</a>, the author of the ever-popular <a href="http://www.scripting.com/">scriptingnews</a> blog. (If you had started blog back in 1994, you could&rsquo;ve got a domain as kewl as his!)</p>

<p>This blog is <a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2009/09/07/teaseTeaseTease.html">neither major (by a long shot) nor complete tech</a>, but it does feel good to be a tiny part of reducing the incessant polling on the web.</p>

<p>If you want to do your part and have a self-hosted wordpress blog, just download the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/rsscloud/">RSSCloud plugin</a> by [Joseph Scott]<a href="Thank you, my man">6</a> and get the engines started.</p>

<p>With Snow Leopard, Apple has the first time done something that has made me go wow! An almost free OS upgrade. This kinda beats the crap out of paying a couple hundred for Win7.</p>

<p>Google reader is one of Google&rsquo;s products, that didn&rsquo;t you didn&rsquo;t realize you needed until you started using it. Heck, pretty much every product they do is in that category. It is one app where I <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/shared/shvelmur">spend a lot of time every day</a>. That is how I still manage to read blogs. Even after <a href="http://twitter.com/shiva">twitter </a>and <a href="http://facebook.com/shivanand">facebook </a>and <a href="http://friendfeed.com/shivanand">friendfeed</a>, GReader is still the place, where you can truly control the signal vs noise ratio of content that you read.</p>

<p>Today, they have turned on a little feature that I have long pained for. It&rsquo;s a little tweak, but a huge convenience. I tend to spend a few days away from reader once in a while, and when I come back, it&rsquo;s a pain to filter out the content you want to read when you have 1000+ items. This little feature let&rsquo;s me choose, which feeds I can ignore completely, which one, I need to read only the last week&rsquo;s worth, etc&hellip;</p>

<p>Thank you Google, for doing the right thing.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Aug 8, 2009</span>
        <p>Hi Jason,</p>

<p>I was writing a post very much on the same lines, when I read your mail. I&rsquo;m on my 3rd ipod, 1st iphone and 2nd MBP (one which I ordered just last week). I don&rsquo;t think I can in the right mind buy another iphone or ipod for the amount of control that apple gets.</p>

<p>1. Absolutely. This is a no-brainer, that I&rsquo;m frankly surprised that Steve Jobs does not see?! Well not really. Apple has always been a closed company. I was under the impression that Apple was a *hardware* company. This behaviour of blocking other applications from talking to Apple products is not only insane, and unfair to the consumer, it quite frankly against the interest of Apple shareholders. I&rsquo;m pretty sure that having more ways to access data on Apple devices will have a direct impact on the sales of those products. Any product manager or marketeer who has desgined/sold electronics products will see the sense in this.</p>

<p>2. Absolutely. And I hope that the FCC hammer comes down quick. With the blocking of the Google App, it becomes a clear case of diminishing the experience of the user. This could be the way out for Apple to end exclusivity deals.</p>

<p>3. I don&rsquo;t think it a question of forgiving Apple. The consumer never forgives, he/she just chooses the product that best suits his/her needs. Apple already went through a round of this with the desktop wars and lost bitterly. It&rsquo;s sad that they haven&rsquo;t learnt their lesson.</p>

<p>Having said all of this, I still love their products, it&rsquo;s their product mgmt that I hate.</p>

<p>(This post is a response to a message on Jason&rsquo;s list. If you are not subscribed to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Calacanis">Jason Calacanis</a>, you should be. Go there NOW)</p>

<p>A little apocalyptic, but not beyond the realm of possibility. Of course, this does assume memes as fact, when in reality it is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme">quite circumspect</a>.</p>

<p>This is awesome. I was born a few years after the race to the moon. What a great time it would have been for all those that got to see/hear this live! In the four decades, life on earth has changed so much &ndash; we&rsquo;ve been de-sensitized to the miracle of flight and technology , and yet the spectacle of space travel is exhilarating as ever.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Wed, Jul 29, 2009</span>
        <p>Over the weekend, I bit the bullet and bought a pair of really good speakers by KEF - the iQ70 series.</p>

<p><a href="http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/shiva/E4r2AzeUT1YFBixmK1hO5mgLIbxa9CslhbFmksV2ERruhs8OHyZeWBQkn3oL/IMG_0061.jpg"><img src="http://blog.shiv.me/images/IMG_0061.jpg.scaled.500.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>As I listened to them, for the last couple of days, I realised something that is, quite obvious, yet, goes unnoticed all the time. I wanted to show my parents how great this new set of speakers were. Even with all the advances in science and technology, I could not really convey how great the speakers sounded. It occured to me that there is no way to share experiences unless we share similar quality equipment. You could record video in HD, with a <a href="http://www.red.com/cameras/">RED camera</a>, but unless the person seeing it uses equally high quality display, there is no way, he/she is going to get the same experience you had. To some extent we have, acheived parity in display quality, and hence can convey images and video without losing much of the experience. However we are nowhere near ubiquitous when it comes to sound. Other factors like touch, thermal state, smell etc and completely beyond our prowess to express. However, we must pat ourselves in the back a little, coz in a matter of decades we&rsquo;ve gone from a select few being able to communicate across great distances to several million all at once, in a matter of decades.</p>

<p>Maybe in the next 100 years, we&rsquo;ll be able to figure out how to use equipment that we already have in common, equipment that mostly has similar specs across every person in the world &ndash; our brains (some are more active than others, but most have the capacity). If you thought, that living now is cool, coz of all the web 2.0 stuff, wait till you see brain 2.0.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Thu, Jul 9, 2009</span>
        <p>The last couple of days has been ablaze with news of Google taking over the world, destroying Microsoft and sticking all of humanity on stakes to collect sunlight and convert it to power. Obviously, <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/08/google-chrome-redefining-the-operating-system/">some are elated at this proposition</a>,  <a href="http://www.crunchgear.com/2009/07/08/a-third-opinion-on-google-chrome/">some tentative</a>, and then there are <a href="http://fakesteve.blogspot.com/2009/07/lets-all-take-deep-breath-and-get-some.html">some others</a> <a href="http://technosailor.com/2009/07/09/google-chrome-os-a-lot-to-do-about-nothing/">who think all of this is just hogwash.</a></p>

<p>I have but one thing to show you today. Presenting article number 1, a video by one of the minions at Google.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a tip: people on Times Square have no, frigging, clue of what a browser is. Don&rsquo;t even get me started on, where the OS stops and the browser starts. The people you are trying to sell this to, don&rsquo;t give a shit. The people who do know what a browser is, think you are just crap-shooting them.</p>

<p>Oh, since I do know what a browser is, considering that I&rsquo;ve used one since 95, I will say, that writing a shell on a linux kernel, and distributing it with only one app, does not make it an OS. It is a linux distro. I&rsquo;m sure the following are familiar: Ubuntu, RedHat, Suse (Novell), which are all the same as Google Chrome (or atleast what they say it will be).</p>

<p>So Google, stop <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/07/introducing-google-chrome-os.html">messing with things that don&rsquo;t make you money</a> and go fix that bug in Gmail or Google reader or maybe you can add RSS support to blogs on blogspot (the rest of the sane world did that only 5 years ago). We, who use your &ldquo;free&rdquo; ad-filled products will be very pleased. Oh yeah, while you are at it, figure out a way to <a href="http://gigaom.com/2009/01/22/google-good-at-search-bad-at-investments/#comment-922970">monetize those millions you invested</a> in wonderful companies (Remember youtube, jaiku, jotspot, dodgeball, orkut, grandcentral ?! ). You might also want to consider improving this thing you helped invent &ndash; search. I hear that there is a <a href="http://www.bing.com/">new-comer</a>. He sounds bad, and has a shitty name, but [he&rsquo;s getting better at it][7].</p>

<p>Now, that&rsquo;s it for today&rsquo;s rant. Get off my lawn, I need to go google myself (Damn, this is therapeutic).</p>

        <p>I can&rsquo;t claim to be someone is really into environment protection, and I&rsquo;m not crazy paranoid about the junk I produce, but I do care about me, my family, and the future of mankind (mostly in that order). I recycle as much as I can, I try to avoid plastic bags, I don&rsquo;t throw garbage on the streets (I&rsquo;m shaking my fist at you, Shivanand-in-India-who-doesn&rsquo;t-live-there-anymore) etc.</p>

<p>I own a Macbook, and I wouldn&rsquo;t say that I&rsquo;m a big fan of Apple &ldquo;the company&rdquo;. However, I really like their products. The latest version of the macbook &ndash; that I&rsquo;m not going to upgrade to &ndash; has given me reason to like it even more! Apple has made a huge stride, in making computer more environment friendly. Here&rsquo;s the laundry-list of things they have eliminated from the Macbook (you read it right, ELIMINATED)</p>

<ul>
<li>Arsenic</li>
<li>BFR (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brominated_flame_retardant">Brominated Flame Retardant</a>)</li>
<li>Mercury</li>
<li>PVC</li>

<p>The packaging is smaller by30-40% (on what was already a very small package). Ohhh.. I fail to mention the unibody Aluminium construction, which is not only durable, but also, completely recyclable!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, but the Apples cost so much more than the average-Joe PC! Why should I pay for eliminating stuff I don&rsquo;t care about?&rdquo;, you ask.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh well, let me tell you something&rdquo;, person-that-I-just-made-up-and-bashed-your-face-in-for-asking-such-a-stupid-question (That&rsquo;s from <a href="http://wilwheaton.typepad.com/wwdnbackup/2009/03/operation-crazy-idea-presents-the-criminal-minds-production-diary-the-audio-version.html">reading Wil Wheaton</a>, btw).</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is what happens to your average-Joe PC, once you are done with it in 6-months&rdquo;.</p>

<p>It gets dumped in third-world developing countries. Well, it is technically called &ldquo;exporting used goods&rdquo;. Used goods aren&rsquo;t much use when they don&rsquo;t work, are they? Of course, as it happens the people who are dealing with scrap, do so, because they have to find a way to eat the next day.</p>

<p>Anyway, I digress. Back to Apple now.</p>

<p>I think it is super that they have decided to invest engineering effort in make the products we use more environment friendly. Ofcourse, this doesn&rsquo;t mean that you need to run out and get that spanking new Macbook that you don&rsquo;t need. However, the next time you decide to buy a computer, think about this video, and see if you can wait a little longer to save up a little more to be able to buy the Macbook.</p>

<p>You can find more details about the environment friendliness of the macs at the following links</p>

        <p>I&rsquo;m a bit of a stickler, when it comes to audio recording. I hate using the mics that come with laptops or the standard desktop mic. Recently, a co-worker asked me about my setup (I record a piano, strictly for my listening pleasure, and NO, MIDI doesn&rsquo;t count).</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t find the links for my version of the mic, but here are some equivalents.</p>

<p><strong>USB Mics</strong></p>

<p>Once you start using a condenser mic, and hear the richness of the output, you&rsquo;ll never want to go back to the crappy on-board mics.</p>
