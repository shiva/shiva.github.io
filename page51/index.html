    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2005/10/website-sruce-up">Website Sruce UP</a></h1>

    <div id="post">
      <p>I need some ideas for my website and blog. I still have not been able to integrate and modify my blog well enough. Wordpress is great, but it sorely lacks some core CMS functionality, like for instance the ability to add pages to my site. I know you can add static pages, but I need to be able to create another changeable content page like what <a href="http://phpnuke.org">php-nuke</a> provides for instance.</p>
<p>I'm trying to organize some of the plugins and features I would like in my blog:</p>
<ul>
<li> Drop-down javascript box displaying relevant content - <a href="http://www.methodize.org/quicksub/#Download">quickSub</a></li>
<li>A plugin for displaying my bookshelf
<ul>
<li>what I have recently read/ reading and going to read)</li>
<li>link to my reviews if I have made any</li>
<li>create a new review for a book</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A front page like that of <a href="http://alexking.org/">Alex King</a></li>
<li>  Link my pixelpost <a href="http://shvelmur.com/ppost/">photoblog </a>to wordpress </li>
</ul>
<p>I have no idea if there are any plugins that do what I want. while I keep searching for them, let me hope that someone leaves a link or two along to shorten my quest. Or else, one of these days, I might finally choose to get off my butt and learn php and hack away at wordpress</p>

    <div id="post">
      <p>What a lousy week it has been... I've had this fever all week long, and is still poking its head around me now and then..</p>
<p>I have been down for the last few days with a viral fever. I also made the mistake of calling my family and telling them that I am unwell. They got very worried and came to Chennai in a taxi to pick me up (my mom). (That was embarrasing ... but did feel well pampered).</p>
<p>I will be getting my new <a href="http://www.creative.com/products/product.asp?category=213&subcategory=214&product=10795">Creative Zen micro</a> (mp3 player) next week. Guru tell's me it sounds awesome. I hope he has got the <a href="http://www.sennheiser.com/sennheiser/icm_eng.nsf/root/products_headphones_streetwear_hdseries_05176">Sennheiser HD 202 headphones</a> I had him asked to buy. I'm gonna have a ball of a time next week, when I can finally lay hands on some kewl gadgets that I've been wanting to buy!</p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2005/09/talking-about-ui-interfaces">Talking about UI interfaces</a></h1>

    <div id="post">
      <p>As technology enters our lives, dare I say, invade our lives, the concept of radical design has been ubiquitous. It's design, design and more design, for last few days for me. I came across quite a few very kewl interfaces and design concepts (a detailed listing below). Some much of what we do, is so dependant on how efficiently a product has been designed. How minimal and useful the interface is.</p>
<p>some kewl sites and resources<br />
<a href="http://www.brendandawes.com/sketches/play-doh/" target="_blank">Use play-doh to control media content</a><br />
Apps on AJAX <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meebo" target="_blank">Meebo </a> <a href="http://www.netvibes.com/" target="_blank">Netvibes</a> <a href="http://www.kiko.com/index.htm" target="_blank">Kiko</a></p>
<p>Check these websites out. Some insanely kewl and creative stuff.</p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2005/09/opera-for-free-yipeee">Opera for free! Yipeee!</a></h1>

    <div id="post">
      <p>There was once a wondeful browser called "Opera". The lucid interface, the smal memory footprint - it was simply browsing heaven.</p>
<p>Then came the version loaded with ads, heavy, sluggish UI and a hug memory footprint in the name of new improved UI. The ads loaded version of opera turned out to nag-ware and I totally detested it and moved to other browsers (read Firefox). Get online and check websites out became "swimming" and not "surfing"</p>
<p>Finally, the good old days are back! get the latest version of Opera sans ads for free.</p>
<p><a href="http://my.opera.com/shvelmur/affiliate/"><img src="/images/120x60noads.png" alt="The best in browsing" /></a></p>
<p>Enjoy! Welcome back to the internet -let's go surfing</p>

    <div id="post">
      <p>After a week long battle with my host sending email back and forth, I managed to get my site back online!<br />
Hopefully now, I can start posting some of the events of the last two weeks. Very eventful mind you. Check back in a couple of days.</p>
