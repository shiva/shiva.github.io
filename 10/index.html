        <span class="post-date">Wed, Mar 7, 2007</span>
        <p>I&rsquo;ve been hosting this site for over 2 years now. Nothing much has come of it, except satisfying my own ever-growing obsession with all things that are related to &ldquo;The Web&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Over time, I have managed to accumalate a lot of unwanted scripts, html files, tools and code snippets, that I have randomly uploaded to my website. It is a junkyard of sorts, and several attempts at clean it up has ended in adding more crud.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m attempting to clean up my online junkyard, yet again, just as <a href="http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/southasia/History/Mughals/mahmud_mughals.html">Mahmud of Ghazni invaded the Indian sub-continent 17 times</a>. Here are few things that I&rsquo;m doing, which are keeping me from posting, not to mention a 1000 entries in my google reader, loads of work at office, the <a href="http://shvelmur.com/wpress/sharpalbum/">impending release of #Album</a> and not to mention <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/shared/14480565058256660224">Mr. Scoble, who doesn&rsquo;t let me sleep</a>.</p>

<ol>
<li>Conform to <a href="http://no-www.org"><img src="http://blog.shiv.me/images/blog-button.gif" alt="No-www.org" /></a>.</li>
<li>Remove all static html files</li>
<li>Separate tech items from normal blog. (I&rsquo;m thinking of using wordpress categories to do this)</li>
<li>Install <a href="http://www.google.com/a/">google-apps</a> on a sub-domain.</li>
<li>Uninstall all tools (photoblog etc)</li>
</ol>

<p>Apart from those, here are a few ideas that continue to crowd my mind.</p>

<ol>
<li>Gadgets for google desktop to connect with google notebook</li>
<li>Plugin to publish google notebook to blog (think WLW and Wordpress)</li>
<li>Extend <a href="http://shvelmur.com/wpress/projects/wpexapi/">wordpress extended RPC</a> to support getTagSuggestions()</li>
<li><a href="http://www.feedmap.net/">Feedmap</a> plugin for wordpress.</li>
</ol>

<p>So If you are interested in working on any of the ideas listed above or listed <a href="http://shvelmur.com/wpress/2007/01/30/plugin-ideas-for-windows-live-writer/">here</a>, or if you have a solution that solves some of the stuff I&rsquo;m trying to do, do get in touch with me.</p>

<p>In other news&hellip;.</p>

<p>Also, in my online surfing adventures (on Google reader), I came across <a href="http://bink.nu/Article9664.bink">this gem</a>. Finally, there seems to be some sanity out there. Product Manager(s) of Ms Office have realised that it is not enough if they make good products, but also keep customers happy in doing so. OpenXML is now finally &ldquo;open&rdquo;, thanks to <a href="http://novell.com">Novell</a> (&lt;&ndash; I work here :) ), which has created a <a href="http://odf-converter.sourceforge.net/">OOXML plugin for open office</a> (I guess I&rsquo;m a little late to the game here).</p>

<p>As usual, the <a href="http://boycottnovell.com/category/open-xml/">nay</a>-sayers, who now seem to be persistent upon the idea that companies need to be charitable organisations instead of making money for their shareholders. To them , I say, &ldquo;Go buy some Novell or Microsoft shares, hold them for 2 years and then talk of product strategy. They will listen to you then :) &ldquo;</p>

<p>Ok. No more talk. Pressing Publish!!</p>

        <span class="post-date">Sun, Mar 4, 2007</span>
        <p>[Nishabd][0] is a re-make of the very famous russian movie, Lolitta. I know, that the flavour of the day is re-mixing movies, but I must confess.. what a re-make? Amazing movie! I was simply blown away by the pathos of the story, the power of Amitabh&rsquo;s eyes and the great performances of every single character.</p>

<p>Personally, I think, this is the best performance by Amitabh. yes.. even more than Black. He has truly scaled peaks that probably most actors in the world can ever see. Finally, a movie that has created some hope for bollywood and the Indian film industry. We have class, we are the masters of pathos. We can do with more Nishabd&rsquo;s. Mr. RGV, are you listening?</p>

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Feb 24, 2007</span>
        

<p><a href="http://shvelmur.com/images/wpress/HellviaSifyBroadband_CA0A/sifymail10.jpg"><img src="http://blog.shiv.me/images/sifymail_thumb8.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>I had a hell of a time connecting using sify &ldquo;narrow&rdquo;band connection. After umpteen calls to sify call center, I decided to send mails to the CEO,CTO and Communications Officer of Sifycorp, to let them know of the pathetic state of affairs, and horrible experience of being a sify broadband user. I have attached a snapshot of the mail that I sent to them.</p>

<p>Here is the content of the mail in totem.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hi Ranjith,<br />
Firstly, my id with satyam broadband is SHVELMUR</p>

<p>I own a sify broadband connection for over the last one year.</p>

<p>I have spent more time contacting your technical staff than using your Internet connection in the last few months. Today, I had to sign in through your connection to attend a conference call (work related). I was unable to do so since my account was inactivated. So I called up your customer service 3 times (that&rsquo;s how many time you need to try to give you some business)and finally got hold of a customer executive, who took a request for renewal.I was initially impressed that only 3 calls were required to get some work done.</p>

<p>I was proved to be wrong. Five minutes after I started using your connection, in the midst of a chat with my customer, I lost connectivity. Not to be discouraged, I attempted calling your dreaded call center for a resolution. In 3 more tries, I got through to your customer care executive, and explained my urgency, raised a ticket and asked for a quick resolution or the phone number of the local operator in charge of my connection. Apparently, the information is not available to your agents, and hence was denied the phone number.</p>

<p>I waited for 2 hours, and called again, to get some status on the ticket and had a skill set abort. (your agent essentially cut the call on me)<br />
I called yet again, in about 20 mins time, and got in touch with Ms Latha, who provided me with your mail address.</p>

<p>After multiple interaction with your company in the last year, I&rsquo;m completely disillusioned with your service, and hence I&rsquo;m copying the CEO, the CTO, and the HR Head, hoping that they would be to some extent concerned about the pathetic situation at your enterprise.</p>

<p>By any chance if you want to reach me, you can respond using the following:<br />
web link : [I posted this mail here.][1]<br />
phone: 0413 2243583<br />
weekend mobile: +91 9894545527<br />
weekday mobile: +91 9901066344</p>

<p>If you can resolve/provide my with some status/the phone number of the local service provider (in my area - Pondicherry). Please send me the details.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I will keep you posted as to how responsive (or not) the sify guys are. Let us see if we can drive some efficiency and responsibility into our so-called giants of Indian IT.</p>

<p>Update: I guess to get prompt service, we need to raise a hullaboo and send mails to CEO, CTO and CCOs of the company. Well, atleast they did respond and I got a call within 10 minutes of the mail asking if my connection works. After about 30 minutes, they got it working. Good work, but next time, please do it before I send mails to your mom. :)</p>

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Feb 24, 2007</span>
        <p>Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam, has been, by far, the best president that India has ever had (atleast in my humble opinion). More than that, he has been one of the greatest ambassador of India and its culture.</p>

<p>He is the most energetic  motivated I have known in my life. He is about to complete his term at the office of the President, and the following is a petition to extend his term at the helm of the country. I personally can&rsquo;t think of anyone who can do justice to that role, better than him. So please, let us join together and raise our voices, so that someone who has done the country a lot of good, can continue to do so.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Thu, Feb 22, 2007</span>
        <p>One of my good friends, James (who wants to remain anonymous), asked me how I lost weight. So for his benefit and hopefully to inspire others here it is.</p>

<ol>
<li>Learn to ride a pulsar 180 at low speeds</li>
<li>Ride around town until you find a road with some engine oil on it.</li>
<li>Apply brakes (disc brakes are the most prefered) as soon as you ride on the oil. (Not mandatory, usually ride on the oil suffices, but just in case)</li>
<li>As you fall off the bike (you will, trust me on this one), use your elbow to soften the blow on your fat-saturated body.</li>
<li>The above step, will result in you waking up in post-op in an orthopaedic hospital.</li>
<li>Once your head is clear, call your manager and ask for a month off.</li>

<li><p>Once you have got leave clearance, the natural proceedings will help you shed those extra pounds off. Any of the below mentioned acitivities will help ensure that you DO NOT try to reach for that extra cup cake/ snacks (which ever is applicable).</p></li>

<li><p>Grow a cat, which inadvertedly jumps on your broken arm, atleast 5 times a day.</p></li>

<li><p>Try eating with a cast on your arm</p></li>

<li><p>Play need for speed (NFS) with two fingers</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Well, there is it. Everything mentioned here, happened, and results are garrentied for those who are brave enough to attempt it!</p>

<p>Truly inspirational. (Speechless)</p>

<p>All I can say is, &ldquo;Way to go, dude&rdquo; like a thousand others have already wished you. I hope that your pitch to Google, gets us yet another cool Google product, and I hope to see the day an announcement is made on some Google blog.</p>

        <p>I wonder what&rsquo;s happening to me. This is the third post in the last one hour. I must be going crazy. Anyway, this must the least used blog on earth, so what the heck. (I know there are a few of you out there, but you don&rsquo;t say much on my blog!! :( )</p>

<p>Before I bore you into leaving this page, here&rsquo;s what this post is about:</p>

<p><strong>Have you seen this somewhere?</strong></p>

<p>(Ohh.. for those who can&rsquo;t place that photo, isn&rsquo;t that a wallpaper that comes with Windows XP?!)</p>

<p>Nick Toshces, asked himself that, and didn&rsquo;t stop at that. He went about asking half the world. He bullied Microsoft, Bill Gates, a few of his friends and the photographer himself. So where is this place? Find out <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/ontheweb/features/2007/02/autumn200702?printable=true¤tPage=all">here</a>.</p>

<p>This is one problem that you wouldn&rsquo;t face with Windows Vista. Check out <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/01/25/1529570.aspx">this</a> and <a href="http://www.istartedsomething.com/20070126/finding-vista-wallpapers/">this</a>.</p>

<p>Btw, if you find it difficult (lazy/bored), to load up my website, please use a feedreader.

I use <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/view/">Google reader</a>, which is probably google&rsquo;s best app till date, apart from search and gmail. You can read it from anywhere, including my new [Nokia N73][7], which I think is a pretty amazing feature. (I can&rsquo;t share from my mobile - such a drab)</p>

        <span class="post-date">Thu, Feb 15, 2007</span>
        <p>I dropped my trusty ol&rsquo; Nokia 6610, from the third floor, at my office. After scourring the gazillion models and options that are available out there, I settled on two phones.</p>

<p>Sony Ericsson K790 Cybershot</p>

<p>Nokia N73</p>

<p>guess what, although the other phones seem to catch up on paper, in reality nokia still wins hands-down. Just hold the two phones in your hand, and you know that the Nokia oozes quality. There are a few gripes though, which I will reserve for later.</p>

<p>Without anymore blabbering, here are some images that I took, without tweaking anything. Be warned that I have left exposure, white balance, flash and iso, all at auto mode.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Wed, Feb 14, 2007</span>
        <p>I have been twidling with HTTP Persistent connections in the last few weeks. Let me start at the beginning</p>

<p>I needed to replace CORBA in a legacy application with something new. Ofcourse, there are a few alternatives out there, but I needed something very lightweight. The problem had two major parts</p>

<ol>
<li>Command Execution - Let the client, execute a function on the server-side and process the output data</li>
<li>Eventing - Make clients register for events and wait until some events occur and the server transmits the required objects to the client side.</li>
</ol>

<p>The Command execution was simple. Expose all services provided by the server as SOAP services and make the clients talk SOAP/XML, however SOAP involves a lot of overhead in terms of serialising the object into an XML stream and later decoding that. Since both the client and server were completely in Java, I just had to transport the Java object itself<br />
The event part, however, provided a challenge. I had restrictions on opening ports on the clients (Issues like firewalls, NAT, SSL support etc etc). So I chose to use HTTP itself to do eventing.</p>

<p>So how do we do that?!</p>

<p>You will need a servlet container like Tomcat. Tomcat supports HTTP 1.1 connections and sends a keep-alive until the servlet servicing is complete. Doing eventing requires the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>The connection between client and server should remain for the entire life of the client or server (whichever is shorter ;) )</li>
<li>Both ends should listen at the ends of the connection for any event.</li>
<li>Server should have an eventing mechanism to forward events to the required clients.</li>
</ol>

        <span class="post-date">Sun, Feb 11, 2007</span>
        <p>After a long ride from Bangalore, whilst I was sleeping blissfully, some rascal, ran through our house, ate an apple, stole a couple of jars of Pickle (good ones at that), helped himself to the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>My Philips DVD player (it was skipping at most DVDs anyway)</li>
<li>An old Sony Tape recorder/player (apparently, some was wrong with it, and needed replacement)</li>
<li>1 apple (worth Rs 25, but actually priceless since my wife got it for me)</li>
<li>2 bottles of mushroom pickle</li>
<li>1 bottle of mushroom, and 1 bottle of (the famous) panchranga pickle (five types of fruit and vegetables)</li>
</ul>

<p>Ohh.. also he chased my cats out.</p>

<p>Well, looks as if nothing else is missing. Only the hollow feeling that someone invaded my den when I was sleeping. That kinda robs the secure feeling that one feels, when one is at home!</p>

<p>Whoever you are, you better not get caught, coz I really loved those bottles of pickle! (They were from Punjab - you see) :)</p>

<p>Update: Apparently, he flicked a pack of cigarettes also!! (He&rsquo;s even helping me quit smoking!!). Also a bottle of after-shave that my wife bought for me!</p>

<p>It is quite surprising that there are hardly any open-source to validate XML out there. I had the need to validate a auto-generated XML output against a valid xsd, to see if the code that I wrote to generate XML was producing not only syntactically correct XML, but also XML that was data-valid. <strong>XML Validator</strong>, provides an UI that allows you to check the validity of any XML, in with reference to its xsd. It is free for Personal and Commercial use without any warranties. So don&rsquo;t come to me if it makes your dog barks all night, or if your computer commits suicide.</p>

<li>If a namespace is used for the XML, it should be provided as input.</li>

<li>CLI support for integration with test scripts.</li>

        <p>Firstly, thanks Scoble.. I think I&rsquo;ll stop reading other gadget/tech sites .. you are my new feed filter.</p>

<p>Secondly, I got a whiff of yet another web 2.0 (does that even mean anything these days!) application site. <a href="http://www.nexo.com/">Nexo</a> is a wonderful wonderful site. just as Scoble says &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Yahoo Groups done right&rdquo;.</p>

<p>It took me the whole of 1 min to create my account, invite a few friends and setup my own group. Oh yeah, it also provides me with web-space to put my photos etc.</p>

<p>One thing I would have loved to see, is a way to integrate this with my exisitng site. It&rsquo;s great that I have a nice dashboard, a place to interact with my friends, but I also want them to read some custom content. If only, I could provide a space where my network could read my RSS from NEXO. I know that&rsquo;s being a bit demanding, but hey it&rsquo;s Web 2.0 time. Integration is the key?! no?!</p>

        <span class="post-date">Thu, Feb 1, 2007</span>
        <p>Yesterday, I was watching an interview with <a href="http://www.hackingmobilephones.com/">Mr Ankit Wadia</a> (His website describes him as &ldquo;The Computer Security guru. The Ethical Hacker. The Author. The Intelligence Consultant. The Entrepreneur.&rdquo;)</p>

<p>He was talking about how the web is unsecure today and how easy it is to crack passwords. Whilst, I was eagerly awaiting in anticipation to see how he hack into a yahoo password, he pulled a bluff on me, when he asked the presenter to enter his password and then he went about using Revelation to read the password from it!</p>

<p>Now, Mr Wadia, do you really think that the Indian IT guys are so very dumb that you have to show how to use revelation?! I agree that most users in India are blissfully oblivious to the potential hazards and lack of privacy on the net, but come on! Can&rsquo;t you find any oft repeated behaviour that people use that you can show case?!</p>

<p>I am no security guru or even an ethical hacker or author of a book, but I can think of a few things that people often do that can be avoided.</p>

<ol>
<li>Using low strength passwords (children names, wife&rsquo;s name, dog&rsquo;s name etc)</li>
<li>Using the save password option in web-cafes</li>
<li>Using the same password across all accounts</li>
<li>reply to spam and phishing attacks with sensitive information</li>
<li>Giving away CVV numbers freely on the net</li>
<li>Publishing phone numbers and address on social networking sites like orkut/gazzag/yahoo profile etc.</li>
</ol>

<p>I wish that apart from getting on air to promote stuff that you do, you can also give some real examples of lack of common security practices, so that people really do benefit (so that they feel a little bit more justified in acknowleding you as India&rsquo;s only security guru - a wee bit self-proclaiming, wouldn&rsquo;t you say so?!)</p>

<p>The author in the above link suggest that how adding some humor, may help in retentivity of the subject in the minds of your audience.</p>

        <p>Been using Windows Live Writer as my blog writing tool. Here are some plugins that I would definetly make my life much easier. If you are insterested in writing a plugin or would like to add to these requirements, do get in touch.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Extended Link insertion</strong>

<ul>
<li>Link to different Search Engines (Google, Google Blog Search, Code search, Sun API search, Technocrati search etc.)</li>
<li>Link to various product sites (Amazon, RitzCamera etc)</li>
<li>Link to previously exisitng Posts</li>
<li>Recent Links</li>
<li>Links from clipboard</li>
<li>Auto-link insertion based on certain keywords</li>
<li>Multiple link inclusion - when this mode is enabled every word that is clicked on / selected should be added to a bucket, which can then be used to create links on.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Note-taking</strong>

<ul>
<li>Separate interface for storing notes/ideas for blog entries</li>
<li>Allow search across notes</li>
<li>Auto-complete using phrases from existing notes (optional)</li>

</ul></li>

<ul>

</ul></li>
<li><strong>Wordpress Style Support#</strong></li>
<li><strong>Review Publishing#*</strong>

<ul>
<li>Wordpress plugin that allows to create a set of reviews for various products</li>
<li>Allow access of reviews separate from posts. (can use a set of categories for this - similar to asides plugin)</li>
<li>Allow posting to this through categories, or allow through a plugin in windows live writer as &ldquo;write review&rsquo;</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Drafts sync#</strong>

<ul>
<li>Allow multiple instances of windows live writer to share drafts.</li>
<li>upload selected drafts to wordpress</li>
<li>check-box for using wordpress drafts instead of local drafts</li>
<li>button for pulling drafts from wordpress and adding them to local drafts</li>

        <p>I&rsquo;m now officially one of the self-obssessed techie guys, sitting in public places and completely ignoring all the life-forms around me. Got a very nice deal from HP. Here is the config!</p>

<p><a href="http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/in/en/ho/WF06b/1090709-1116637-1116665-1116665-1116665-12724286-78159183.html?jumpid=oc_R1002_INENC-001_HP%20Pavilion%20dv2124tu%20Notebook%20PCâŒ©=en&amp;cc=in"><strong>HP Pavillion DV2124TU</strong></a><br />
Intel Pentium Core Duo 1.6 Ghz<br />
1 GB (2 X 512 MB) DDR2 SDRAM<br />
Intel 945 800Mhz FSB Motheboard<br />
14.1&rdquo; Widescreen Display<br />
LightScribe DVD-RW drive<br />
802.11 a/b/g wireless<br />
Bluetooth<br />
Infrared<br />
Altec Lansing Speakers<br />
Built in modem and ethernet ports<br />
3 USB ports<br />
1 DV based USB<br />
SD/MMC-Pro/MS/XD card reader<br />
Remote control for DVD player<br />
Windows XP Media Center Edition</p>

<p>It costs around Rs. 56000 in India. Since I bought the laptop before the 31 jan 2007, I get the following freebies</p>

<p>Hauppage USB TV tuner card<br />
Reliance USB Internet Data card</p>

<p>This is essentially the dv2000 branded as 2124 in India. oh yeah, since I bought it betwwen Nov 06 and Mar 07, I get a free upgrade to Windows Vista when it is released.</p>

<p>It took me the whole of the weekend to get it into working shape, installing all the necessary open source tools that I use. Still a lot of work ahead. I hope to blog more since I have access to decent computing power where ever I go.</p>
