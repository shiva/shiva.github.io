        <p>As I have mentioned earlier, I have recently moved to a new team at office.</p>

<p>This weekend, we went on a team outing to Mahabalipuram. Well, if you are in India and happen to visit Tamil Nadu, do not, and I say again, DO NOT forget to make a trip to Sterling Resorts ( and no, I didn&rsquo;t take money from them to say this )</p>

<p>They have this kewl package to offer. They take you on a boat ride, into the sea (<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>) kilometers and, they throw (not literally) you into the water. Actually,it is more like they help you into the water. You get to hold on to your dear life at the end of a rope! It is great fun to swim in the sea, with nothingness for about <sup>70</sup>&frasl;<sub>80</sub> feet below you. It scares the shit out of you, if you don&rsquo;t know how to swim i.e!</p>

<p>We had a real great time&hellip; ofcourse there is the usual, TT, volleybal etc, but the boat ride was the icing on the cake..</p>

<p>If you are as lucky as we were, you can hear music from a divine voice.. You can contact me for that&hellip; maybe I can cajole Dinesh (ODC&rsquo;s own SPB!) into make a trip with you and sing for you&hellip; ;) just kidding !!</p>

<p>Dinesh you&rsquo;ve got one helluva voice man!!</p>

        <span class="post-date">Wed, Sep 22, 2004</span>
        <p>Had to dump Frequency! :( No support for titles! Based on the old Blogger 1.0 API and free only for 15 days!!. Desperately in need of another client based interface, after moving to opera. It is such a pain, to browse in one environment and having to open IR just for blogging.</p>

<p>I think I should write a client myself based on the atom API. Now that I have a VC environment with me, I might just do that! If at anyone reads this blog, please do get in touch with me if you are interested in write a small VC++ application that will sit on the taskbar, and will let you post to blogger.</p>

<p>Btw, I found a really kewl photo site</p>

<p>[photo.net][0]</p>

<p>A very nice quote on the website -</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;I have discovered photography. Now I can kill myself. I have nothing else to learn&rdquo;</em> &ndash; <strong>Pablo Picasso</strong></p>

        <p>Frequency - client for weblog postingFound a very neat client for posting a blog item on Blogger and other weblogs available!! This is really neat. It let&rsquo;s blog quite comfortably without disrupting my workflow! Not much time wasted in waiting for UI to get loaded and no timeouts and multiple logins in a day!</p>

<p>Anyway, I hope this gets me bloging more regularly!</p>

        <p>and yeah!!! the day has come, when I get to get my hands dirty with some VC++ coding!!</p>

<p>That has been the primary reason for me not blogging for such a long long time. Anyway, after about 15 - 20 days of a good dip in VC++, life is good.</p>

<p>Last week, Priyanka and me, we celebrated our marriage&rsquo;s first anniversary! I drove down to Pondicherry that night (8-sep-2004), on Shankar&rsquo;s bike! The bike is really trashed I say&hellip; At the end of the drive my hands were swollen and red. Gosh, I&rsquo;ve never felt so much vibration on a bike.</p>

<p>On the way, I got to meet a coupla guys, who were fascinated with my helmet!</p>

<p>Had a great time the last coupla weeks. Hoping the good run continues!</p>

<p>Now that is what is happening in this world. Japanese gov is talking about getting a 2 hour moving into their people&rsquo;s homes in just 35 secs apiece! Is the Indian government listening ?!!</p>

        <p>[Matthew Yglesias: June 20, 2004 - June 26, 2004 Archives][0]: &ldquo;The Dialectic of Inaccuracy&rdquo;</p>

<p>Check that article out. One of the most well-written, thought provoking articles in some time!</p>

<p>Anyway, I drove down to Pondy on my bike on Friday! Night ride with Tanigai and Prem. Peaceful, uneventful ride home. Was feeling very happy about it! Not for long. I met with an accident on Sunday morn, thrashed (well, almost. gonna cost me 2500 and upwards).</p>

<p>I was driving along one of the exits from Pondicherry, towards Villanur(my wife&rsquo;s College is on the way), and there was some ongoing repair work. A carrier auto, stopped for me (he was turning right). I went through to cross him, and there he was, 15 to 17 years of age, an idiotic blank grin that was telling me, oops sorry , I didn&rsquo;t mean to but I&rsquo;m stupid, don&rsquo;t have a license to drive, but have a license to kill you! He was right there, stick his head out from behind the auto ( and his bike too) just a foot in front of me.</p>

<p>Wham!!! The next thing I knew was, I was standing there, blood oozing from my left foot, and one bystander and one policeman defending the stupid kid, just coz he is younger and has a smaller bike! &ldquo;Get a life people&rdquo;, I thought and blew my lid off at the police guy for being such a whimp and at encouraing such bad driving practices on the roads.</p>

<p>well, wonder when, people on the roads be accused for their error in driving, rather than based on the size/cost of their vehicles!</p>

        <p>Come on people! What&rsquo;s up with Chennai roads these days.. yeah I can understand that since the city is growing blah, blah, blah, it is going to be congested&hellip;. but you know there is this thing called sanity that departs you when it takes you an hour and half to get from Numgambakkam to Vadapalani!!</p>

<p>I hate it and I hate it and I hate it!! grrrrrrrr!!!</p>

<p>Well, it is madness I say, what&rsquo;s the point in selling bikes over 150 cc and cars the size of a Cessna if there is hardly any room for people to use their vehicles on! Our roads got to go bigger! I know, I know, don&rsquo;t you ask me how?! Figure out how, Corporation of Chennai!</p>

<p>Remove those stupid barriers that is supposed to regularize traffic! All they serve is to congest the roads even more. Take our infamous Arcot road! Who is that brainy road-designer (is that what you call &lsquo;em?) who thought that have a 8 feet road separator on a 40 feet road would ease traffic?! duh?! Get real guys!!</p>

<p>Why is that one has to ride through every conceivable road encroachment from your friendly petty shop to barricade perpendicular to traffic direction ( now, that must be the ingenuity of the Chennai Police! how does reducing the area usable by traffic, help control it?!) to dust bins to every thing that the Almighty created, smack on your path back home , right after you have negotiated, lane cutting autos and practically standstill rickshaws (bang in the middle of the road, not to mention!)</p>

<p>Well, I guess I&rsquo;m a little stressed out, so out for a smoke me go! Gotta quit that one of these days, maybe will help do away with a few petty shops and a few more cig butts on our chennai roads!</p>

<p>Come on old man! Get your grips on. You go on to tell the entire world that you have to attend a secret meeting?! Duh?! That kind of beats the purpose of a secret meeting uh?!</p>

<p>Well, one has to appreciate the efforts of a president, if he thinks that he wants to tell his unedited opinion about things to the people of the world. That is worth applause. It is not that I concur with all his opinions, but if we had a leader or two, who would pick up blogging and will read through the comments that the people give to his opinions, India can become a far better place?!</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t you think so?</p>

        <p>This blogging thingy is turning out to be good. It let&rsquo;s you interface with people and take a sneak peek into their minds, (which btw, I think has been the most characteristic search of humankind in the last century - a peek into the evolving human mind) without tramping on their time or egos!</p>

<p>anyway, on my wayward browsing adventure, I happened to look at a quote posted on one of the blogs by [Heather][0]</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d say I&rsquo;m sorry to disappoint you, but I&rsquo;m not. I excel at not giving a shit. Experience has taught me that interest begets expectation, and expectation beget disappointment, so the key to avoiding disappointment is to avoid interest. A equals B equals C Equals A, or whatever. I also don&rsquo;t have a lot of interest in being a good person or a bad person. From what I can tell, either way, you&rsquo;re screwed. Bad people are punished by society&rsquo;s laws, and good people are punished by Murphy&rsquo;s Law. So you see my dilemma.&rdquo; - Georgia Lass&rdquo; - **Dead Like Me **</p>

<p>Now, how true is that. How many times, have we thought that everytime that we do something real good, we get screwed up for it, and the smallest of demeanors that we are put under the microscope! - well that&rsquo;s life for you!!</p>

<p>and Heather - that you quote, probably echoes the sentiments of most of us in the last two and half decades, with world we live in turning more and more cynical by the day!</p>

        <p>[The Da Vinci Code - FAQs - Official Website of Dan Brown][0]</p>

<p>This book , &ldquo;<em>The Da Vince Code</em>&rdquo; (DVC), by **Dan Brown **is a must read by every person who has ever read a fiction novel. The most gripping tale that I&rsquo;ve heard/read in quite some time.</p>

<p>The audacity of the author to lay questions about the foundations of the one of the most populous religions in this world has to be applauded. Further, he raises questions that make you question yourself!. Now ever, heard of a fiction autor make you do that.</p>

<p>A paperback that makes you think! Now that&rsquo;s a new one.</p>

<p>Btw, if you like the DVC, you might also want to take a peek at &ldquo;<em>The unauthorised guide to the DVC</em>&rdquo; by <strong>Dan Burstein</strong></p>

<p>Is it true that Google is offering a terabyte of space or is it a marketing gimmick as hardly any would cross the 1 GB mark?!</p>
