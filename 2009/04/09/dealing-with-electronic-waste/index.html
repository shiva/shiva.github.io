  <h1 class="post-title">Dealing with electronic waste</h1>
  <span class="post-date">Thu, Apr 9, 2009</span>
  <p>I can&rsquo;t claim to be someone is really into environment protection, and I&rsquo;m not crazy paranoid about the junk I produce, but I do care about me, my family, and the future of mankind (mostly in that order). I recycle as much as I can, I try to avoid plastic bags, I don&rsquo;t throw garbage on the streets (I&rsquo;m shaking my fist at you, Shivanand-in-India-who-doesn&rsquo;t-live-there-anymore) etc.</p>

<p>I own a Macbook, and I wouldn&rsquo;t say that I&rsquo;m a big fan of Apple &ldquo;the company&rdquo;. However, I really like their products. The latest version of the macbook &ndash; that I&rsquo;m not going to upgrade to &ndash; has given me reason to like it even more! Apple has made a huge stride, in making computer more environment friendly. Here&rsquo;s the laundry-list of things they have eliminated from the Macbook (you read it right, ELIMINATED)</p>

<ul>
<li>Arsenic</li>
<li>BFR (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brominated_flame_retardant">Brominated Flame Retardant</a>)</li>
<li>Mercury</li>
<li>PVC</li>
</ul>

<p>The packaging is smaller by30-40% (on what was already a very small package). Ohhh.. I fail to mention the unibody Aluminium construction, which is not only durable, but also, completely recyclable!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, but the Apples cost so much more than the average-Joe PC! Why should I pay for eliminating stuff I don&rsquo;t care about?&rdquo;, you ask.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh well, let me tell you something&rdquo;, person-that-I-just-made-up-and-bashed-your-face-in-for-asking-such-a-stupid-question (That&rsquo;s from <a href="http://wilwheaton.typepad.com/wwdnbackup/2009/03/operation-crazy-idea-presents-the-criminal-minds-production-diary-the-audio-version.html">reading Wil Wheaton</a>, btw).</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is what happens to your average-Joe PC, once you are done with it in 6-months&rdquo;.</p>

<p>It gets dumped in third-world developing countries. Well, it is technically called &ldquo;exporting used goods&rdquo;. Used goods aren&rsquo;t much use when they don&rsquo;t work, are they? Of course, as it happens the people who are dealing with scrap, do so, because they have to find a way to eat the next day.</p>

<p>Anyway, I digress. Back to Apple now.</p>

<p>I think it is super that they have decided to invest engineering effort in make the products we use more environment friendly. Ofcourse, this doesn&rsquo;t mean that you need to run out and get that spanking new Macbook that you don&rsquo;t need. However, the next time you decide to buy a computer, think about this video, and see if you can wait a little longer to save up a little more to be able to buy the Macbook.</p>

<p>You can find more details about the environment friendliness of the macs at the following links</p>
