    <p>Recently I got asked, what the best way to do a join between two large lists,  into another list was? I always tend to answer that question with: it depends.</p>
<p>Just like any other algorithm, there is no silver bullet. It is a trade off  between CPU and memory utilisation. Sometimes, we do have to think about these  things (this is code in c++ on a device with scarce resources, to say the  least).</p>
<p>Of course, the simplest solution for this would be to use multiple for loops:</p>
<p><code>**// merge - version 1**   function List&lt;C&gt; merge(List&lt;A&gt; l1, List&lt;B&gt; l2) {</code></p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p><code>  // oh god! I shouldn't be doing this     for(A a: l1) {       C c = new C(a);       for(B b: l2) {         if (c.foo == b.foo) {           c.add(b);         }       }     }   }  </code></p>
<p>As is obvious any half-decent programmer would shudder at the thought of writing something like this, particularly let it run on a device with limited resources. A simple way to refactor this would be to create an index for one of the lists and iterate through other.</p>
<p><code>**// merge - version 2**   function List&lt;C&gt; merge(List&lt;A&gt; l1, List&lt;B&gt; l2) {</code></p>
<p><code>  // create the index     HashMap&lt;Foo, Bar&gt; map = new HashMap();  </code></p>
<p><code>  for (B b: l2) {       map.put (b.foo, b);     }</code></p>
<p><code>  for(A a: l1) {       C c = new C(a);       c.add(map.get(a.foo));     }   }  </code><br>
Conventional wisdom says, that version 2 is much better than version 1. Right? Well, what if you have 128 MB of shared memory across your system, but a dedicated processor for your subsystem?! Won&rsquo;t you want to pick version 1 in that case? What if both the lists can have millions of entries? That would render both these cases useless.</p>
<p>Sometimes, before trying to find a technical solution to the problem at hand, it might help to ask why? What is the need for this requirement? The key is to ask why until you reach a specific use-case. I tend to ask this all the way until I reach either a SOAP request, or a specific component in the GUI that requires this piece of data. Most of the time, we can get by without writing a potentially inefficient solution.</p>

<p>In this case, after several &ldquo;why&quot;s, I discovered that this requirement came about, since one of the products in our suite (yeah we have a bunch of products that build on each other), need to display a list of names of object C, as the user searches for a specific one to add items to. If we had decided to write either v1 or v2, every time the user opened that GUI component, we would transport, a possible 10000 records from the device all the way to the GUI (which in our case is several layers above), when we only need a list of names based on a specific criteria.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;how&rdquo; of your design depends the &ldquo;why&rdquo;. The only limiting factor is the willingness to ask why, until you can find an alternate solution, or, are absolutely convinced that there is no other way to acheive a specific requirement without writing some inefficient code &mdash; then defend rigorously against doing it. well, atleast you have to get a some kind of limits in place.</p>
<p>Sometimes you have to <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/shvelmur/3262859586/">stand up to your product manager</a>, and sometimes you have to take a <a href="http://blog.shiv.me/2009/01/28/i-recommend-drinking-vin-chaude-when-youre-in-strasbourg-france/">sip of warm wine</a>, and go write that &ldquo;piece of crap&rdquo; code.</p>
<p>Happy coding!</p>
