    <p>Hi Jason,</p>
<p>I was writing a post very much on the same lines, when I read your mail. I&rsquo;m on my 3rd ipod, 1st iphone and 2nd MBP (one which I ordered just last week). I don&rsquo;t think I can in the right mind buy another iphone or ipod for the amount of control that apple gets.</p>
<p>1. Absolutely. This is a no-brainer, that I&rsquo;m frankly surprised that Steve Jobs does not see?! Well not really. Apple has always been a closed company. I was under the impression that Apple was a *hardware* company. This behaviour of blocking other applications from talking to Apple products is not only insane, and unfair to the consumer, it quite frankly against the interest of Apple shareholders. I&rsquo;m pretty sure that having more ways to access data on Apple devices will have a direct impact on the sales of those products. Any product manager or marketeer who has desgined/sold electronics products will see the sense in this.</p>
<p>2. Absolutely. And I hope that the FCC hammer comes down quick. With the blocking of the Google App, it becomes a clear case of diminishing the experience of the user. This could be the way out for Apple to end exclusivity deals.</p>
<p>3. I don&rsquo;t think it a question of forgiving Apple. The consumer never forgives, he/she just chooses the product that best suits his/her needs. Apple already went through a round of this with the desktop wars and lost bitterly. It&rsquo;s sad that they haven&rsquo;t learnt their lesson.</p>
<p>Having said all of this, I still love their products, it&rsquo;s their product mgmt that I hate.</p>
