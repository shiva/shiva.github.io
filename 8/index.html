        <p>Well, this is a first post to my blog using Jott, which is a very cool service. It allows you to call a number and talk what you want to post, and post it to your blog. I think it&rsquo;s one of the new tools that really enable blogging. I&rsquo;m just going to try it and see how it works out. <a href="http://www.jott.com/show.aspx?id=d6549201-5361-44c4-adf3-ef43abf8488c">listen</a></p>

        <span class="post-date">Wed, Apr 2, 2008</span>
        <p>I have the very distinct feeling that a bunch of people from India, are going to visit my site today. Maybe, it is too late, but nonetheless, I was compelled to post before I left for work, after staying up the whole night (watching movies). No really - <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0338526/">Van Helsing</a> followed by <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0765429/">American Gangster</a> - two very find movies, I might add, but I digress.</p>

<p>I got the honour, of being one of the few listed on a fellow <a href="http://blog.yuvisense.net/">tech-enthusiast</a>&rsquo;s list of <a href="http://blog.yuvisense.net/indians-on-twitter/">&ldquo;twittering&rdquo; Indians.</a> It&rsquo;s not everyday that I make someone&rsquo;s list, and hence the compulsion to blog about it. So, thank you Yuvi. Since he described me as a programmer, on his list, it&rsquo;s only fair &ndash;</p>

<p><code>
if (knowsYuvi(you)) {  
Thanks for visiting this [blog][4];  
Between [work][5] and [twitter][6], I hardly update this space anymore;  
Do, [add it to your feedreader][7], so someday, you might see [something][8] [useful][9] :)  
} else {  
visit Yuvi's [blog][2];  
follow him on [twitter][10];  
send him a tweet, saying hi;  
}

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Mar 15, 2008</span>
        <p>I did it! I finally went out and bought myself a mac. I didn&rsquo;t waver. No! Not this time.Â I knew exactly what I wanted, and I was going to get it, come what may!</p>

<p>I have to confess that I have been pretty <a href="http://shvelmur.com/2008/01/29/that-queasy-feeling/">critical of Apple</a> and<a href="http://shvelmur.com/2008/01/18/bye-bye-ipod/">its policies</a>. I still am. Nothing has changed my opinion of Apple as a company, in particular, it&rsquo;s marketing team. The ipod touch price changes lead me to those conclusions.I liked the ipod touch&rsquo;s interface and engineering, but when I first booted up my MacBook (Penryn-based) I was completely taken aback. The first time I booted my laptop, it was completely usable. Within a few hours, I had a few applications installed (open source ones), tweeted, seesmiced my first video, and was having fun, in general. The Mac experience was very very close to the ideal computing experience ever. (Yeah, it is that big a deal).</p>

<p>It is not just the OS, it is the bunch of applications that come with the OS, and others that you can find online, that make that initial user-experience so good. Can you duplicate this experience on a PC running windows or Linux? Of course you can, it just takes a lot of effort, and every application looks and feel different (less so in the linux world) and that is the problem.</p>

<p>The Mac presents a very cohesive user interface (different, but cohesive), that makes using the Mac a pleasure. For instance, I installed Textmate (on which I write this post). It is one of the best apps for OSX, but it doesn&rsquo;t waver from the basic UI guidelines of native OSX apps. That is its strength. All windows look very very similar, and the whole desktop looks a lot more integrated. There is a keyboard shortcut for pretty much every single thing. Having said all of this, there are some behavioral aspects of Mac that I think are counter-intutive.</p>

<p><strong>The counter-intuitive Mac?!</strong></p>

<p>Here are some things that piss me off.</p>

<li>You can select text, using ctrl+shift+arrow,Â up toÂ the end orÂ beginningÂ of line, but you can&rsquo;t move to end or beginning of line, using ctrl+arrow (since it is mapped to move between spaces). Hmm&hellip; what will a normal user, use most?! move to beginning or end of line?! or move between work spaces?!</li>
<li>In the notebook versions of the mac, there are no keys for pg up, pg dn, home, end. Although, these things have lost relevance in the modern day UI, there are still useful. You can use fn+arrows that do the same thing, but only when paging is involved. What else do you need them for , you ask? When I want to go to the beginning of a text field, that is highlighted, or to the end, I use the Home and End keys. That doesn&rsquo;t work on all text fields. Some textboxes in safari support it and some don&rsquo;tI know these are minor, but I use them everytime, I use my laptop.</li>
<li>Why do the applications minimize when I double click on them? (I know it&rsquo;s a windows thing, but I think it&rsquo;s more intuitive to double click to maximize, since I want a windowsÂ maximizedÂ only when I am paying attention to it, and usually as I read through an article, I double click and continue reading. Let me assure you, that it is far more useful to maximize the window on double click than minimize it. Why? I don&rsquo;t think people normally minimize windows they don&rsquo;t use, they just focus the windows they use. If you want to see the desktop, you would use &ldquo;show desktop&rdquo;. I don&rsquo;t see &ldquo;Minimize&rdquo; needed that often as maximize. Also, in OS X, maximize = fit window to content. hmm.. that works for the web apps, but not so much for native apps. In any case, there ought to be some way to force an app to fill the screen. (No! Manually dragging an image to fit a 24&rdquo; screen is not fun, and why I do that?! One word - Lightroom)</li>
</ol>

<p>I know I will get used to the quirks, but they still are exactly that - quirks that are forced on the user (like any other OS out there - to be fair).</p>

        <p>&ldquo;This is it! Its the final straw. We need to do something about it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;, you ask. I am sick and tired of hearing story after story of crazed authority figures, forcing rules upon the common man, rendering life to a boring, monotonous series of security checks and bans and fines. From security at airports, to self-righteous moderation aimed at photographers in public spaces. I am sick of it.</p>

<p>There are a few like <a href="http://thomashawk.com/">Thomas Hawk</a>, who continue to risk holding on to their principles in public, at the risk of crazed comments and flak from an audience that could care less. An example, is his post <a href="http://thomashawk.com/2008/03/question-authority-and-why-its-time-to.html">today</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When I&rsquo;m on an airplane, and the flight attendant tells everyone to turn off their cell phones and personal electronics, I never turn my iPhone off. I just leave it on. I&rsquo;m not sure why I don&rsquo;t turn it of</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why should anyone turn off cellphones? or any electronic equipment for that matter?! every time I get on a plane, all I hear is that, cellphones could cause disruption of air-traffic communication and therefore everyone (usually 500 or more) have to turn off all electrical and electronic appliances.</p>

<p>There are several flaws with this rule.</p>

<ol>
<li>Relying on voice based communication systems that are frail enough to be disrupted by a few cell phones are not safe enough for critical information. Pilots and Air-traffic control, should switch to more reliable data transfer mechanisms.</li>
<li>I am allowed to use my computer and other electronic devices post lift-off but not during it! Is losing communication in the middle of the flight somehow safer that losing it during lift-off?</li>
</ol>

<p>This &ldquo;rule&rdquo; is symptomatic of several rules that we have in modern society: rules that have stopped making sense, but we continue to follow and enforce them senselessly</p>

<ol>
<li>Turn cellphones off near petrol stations.</li>
<li>No flash in museums or photo galleries</li>
<li>(In Canada), if you are the first car at an intersection turning left, and you have a green, move to the middle of the road until you find a space in the on coming traffic. (clear recipe for disaster)</li>
<li>Taking off shoe, toothpaste, comb, hair gel etc and displaying it to the world a.k.a your co-travelers, whilst wondering where all the stuff that they collect goes?!</li>
</ol>

<p>Several things caught my eye, as I re-searched after I read <a href="http://thomashawk.com/2008/03/question-authority-and-why-its-time-to.html">Thomas&rsquo; post</a>.</p>

<p>Check out <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/consumerfacts/cellonplanes.html">this note</a> posted on FCC&rsquo;s website.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In March 2007, the FCC terminated a proceeding that it began in late 2004 to consider potentially lifting this ban. The FCC determined that the technical information provided by interested parties in response to the proposal was insufficient to determine whether in-flight use of wireless devices on aircraft could cause harmful interference to wireless networks on the ground. Therefore, it decided at this time to make no changes in the rules prohibiting in-flight use of such devices.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Essentially, as opposed to proving something is not safe (or safe), the FCC decides to maintain status quo?!</p>

<p>Wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phones_on_aircraft#Technical_issues">article on the Channel reuse</a> :</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Channel reuse works because from a mobile phone on the ground, there will only be one &ldquo;closest&rdquo; tower that can possibly use a particular group of frequencies, CDMA codes, or time slots. The software that manages the system assumes that the signal from a phone on a particular tower can, on other towers, only be &ldquo;heard&rdquo; at greatly reduced signal strength. The frequency, code, or time slot used by the phone can therefore be reused by other phones on other towers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&hellip; and goes on to say &hellip;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If a mobile phone is operated from an aircraft in flight above a city, this assumption is no longer valid, because the towers of many different cells may be about equidistant from the phone. Multiple towers might assume that the phone is under their control. The phone could be assigned a free channel by one tower, but could be heard on other towers using the same channel group, and the channel might already be in use on those towers. This could cause interference with existing calls. It is possible that the software controlling the towers could crash. Even if the software can cope with hearing the same phone on multiple, non-adjacent towers, the result at best is an overall decrease in the system&rsquo;s capacity.</p>

<p>An additional concern is the output power of the mobile handset. Because the towers might be many miles below the aircraft, the phone might have to transmit at its maximum power to be received. This will increase the risk of interference with electronic equipment on the aircraft.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So essentially, the main reason for not allowing is that it could crash cell towers?! (The Wikipedia article provides more instances where there have been next to no evidence of mobile phones impacting air-traffic communication). Now I get why, it has to be switched off just before take-off, and not before entering the plane. Hmmm&hellip; sounds like this regulation is more in the interest of cost control, that safety. The issue I have with legislation like this, is that, I would be happy to comply, if I was told that the true reason.</p>

<p>In the post-<sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub> era, we have become more tolerant to crappy policy-making, and this is true all over the world. The &ldquo;Bush infection&rdquo; and the politics of fear (<a href="http://my.barackobama.com/page/community/post/caitlinharvey/gGgBGW">thanks Obama for bringing that up</a>), has spread way beyond just the US. Every single country has had to suffer repercussions of the fear-tactics, and millions of air-travelers have to suffer for the benefit of the few.</p>

<p>And, this .. this..</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is it! It&rsquo;s the final straw. We need to do something about it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Note: where did the phrase &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the final straw&rdquo; originate. Some answers - <a href="http://www.phrases.org.uk/bulletin_board/41/messages/495.html">here</a> and <a href="http://forum.wordreference.com/showthread.php?t=734447">here</a>.</p>

<p>Update: Check out this <a href="http://www.jkontherun.com/2008/03/virgin-america.html">picture of a Virgin Atlantic Wifi based food ordering system inside a plane</a>. Aparently, the have &ldquo;shielded&rdquo; the cabin with lead and kryptonite to avoid &ldquo;radio interference&rdquo;. (That&rsquo;s sarcasm btw &ndash; borrowed from the source, just in case :) )</p>

        <span class="post-date">Tue, Jan 29, 2008</span>
        <p>A few days ago, I returned the Ipod touch that I had for exactly 11 days, coz Apple chose to charge me $20. Apart from me being a cheap bas***d, I had this queasy feeling in my gut, about apple products. I felt an unexplainable rage towards Apple, Jobs and the fanboys. I am usually a very moderate person, and it really surprised me that I could harbor such crazy extremism and frustration. I could never place a finger on the source, until I read <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/archives/001044.html">this article</a> on Coding Horror by Jeff Atwood.</p>

<p>He hits the nail on the head with this one:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So let&rsquo;s be completely clear: <strong>when you buy a new Mac, you&rsquo;re buying a giant hardware dongle</strong> that allows you to run OS X software.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and goes on to state something, that threw the spotlight on that source that I was trying to find within myself</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m a hypocrite. Maybe the issue cuts philosophically deeper than mere dongles. Maybe it&rsquo;s not only about the freedom to run your operating system on whatever hardware you wish, but also the freedom to run whatever software you want for whatever purpose you need, in perpetuity. That&rsquo;s <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2004/05/14/freedom-0">Freedom Zero</a>:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are two kinds of us: those who put conviction above convenience, and those who don&rsquo;t. There is nothing right or wrong about being on either of the sides. All that matters is that, one needs to understand, which &ldquo;club&rdquo; one belongs to. Through all this, I realized one thing - I will never be content with a Mac, until I convince myself to give up expecting my computer to do everything I want it to do. Do I want to do that? I have no idea. Do I want an ipod touch that allows me to run linux on it? I sure as hell do.</p>

<p>I hope, for the sake of computing, that Apple realizes that it has a platform in the Ipod Touch, get off its proud ass,Â  and open-up the touch to third party. However, with Apple, I just know that it will never happen. Why? It takes genius to build something like the iPhone or the iPod and a vision to make that into a platform.</p>

<p>Timing is becoming critical these days. Although, I guess more people out there learnt about the feature from his blog entry, it is becoming less relevant from the tech-crowd&rsquo;s perspective.

        <span class="post-date">Fri, Nov 30, 2007</span>
        <p>That is a very difficult question to answer (which I don&rsquo;t answer anywhere in this post: go away). Anyone who attempts to do so, must be a genius or a fool, perhaps a little of both. <a href="http://blogoscoped.com/google-blog.html">Philipp Lenssen</a> on <a href="http://blogoscoped.com/">Google Blogoscoped</a>, observes how one of those is true. Here is a more detailed analysis.</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.shiv.me/images/3836395_b29aee123a.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>John Watkins, must have been quite a visionary considering the depth of his predictions and how much of it has come true.</p>

<p><strong>Five hundred Million people</strong></p>

<p>He was right about that, but under-estimated the human ability and eagerness to reproduce (and migrate). Based on the <a href="http://www.census.gov/main/www/popclock.html">US census 2000</a>,Â  the US now has over 300 million inhabitants (that is excluding all the people on H, L and BÂ Visas)</p>

<p><strong>The American will be taller</strong></p>

<p>According to <a href="http://www.halls.md/on/men-height-o.htm">this website</a>, the average height of the American male is somewhere between 160 to 180 cms. Now, since he hasn&rsquo;t provided a figure, there is no way to validate this information.</p>

<p><strong>There will be no C, X or Q</strong></p>

<p>Hmm.. I did a few searches for words starting with C:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.findtheword.info/resultat.php?stype=begins&amp;sword=C">findtheword.info</a> = 47831</p>

<p><a href="http://wordhut.com/browse/c/1.htm">wordhut.com</a> = 274 pages of 51 words each (13974)</p>

<p>Needless to say, these are just ones that start with one of the letters he mentions. It ain&rsquo;t happening anytime soon.</p>

<p><strong>Hot and Cold Air from Spigots</strong></p>

<p>A <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=home+heating+systems&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a">search for &lsquo;home heating systems&rsquo;</a> on google gave about 33 million results in 0.15 seconds. Thankfully, we are way ahead of what someone a hundred years ago could imagine, how we would heat ourselves.</p>

<p><strong>No mosquitoes or flies</strong></p>

<p>Not much of a change there (although, if you are reading this, then you probably live in a place will lesser mosquitoes than 100 years back)</p>

<p>One thing, I bet he never, in his wildest dreams, would have conceived was that we will have patents for <a href="http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/5733552-description.html">mosquito repellents</a></p>

<p><strong>Ready-cooked meals</strong></p>

<p>We have found a million ways to feed ourselves, and this includes fast-food, and packaged dinners and Martha Stewart&rsquo;s. Sweet Success!</p>

<p><strong>No foods will be exposed</strong></p>

<p>In the US, maybe, but there are still quite a few places in the world, where this is not erradicated (hint: take a flight to India and visit Arcot Road, Chennai, Tamil Nadu - also take life-insurance before you go (I can be your nominee - use the contact form for such purposes or <a href="http://twitter.com/shvelmur">tweet me</a>.))</p>

<p><strong>Coal will not be used for heating or cooking</strong></p>

<p>Woot! Woot! Google, good for ye. You are trying to do what someone thought of 100 years back. Go tidal power.</p>

<p><strong>There will be no street cars in our large cities</strong></p>

<p>Yeah right.</p>

<p><strong>Photographs will be telegraphed</strong></p>

<p>2 cheers here. We even went a step further and invented this thingy called the internet, and we actually <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/shvelmur">have</a> <a href="http://zooomr.com/photos/shiva">quite</a> a few <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=photo+sharing">sites</a> (about 100,000)Â out there helping us do this. (big business these days uh?)</p>

<p><strong>Trains @ 150 miles/hour</strong></p>

<p>Sadly, the US has moved away from trains and on to air-traffic in the last 100 years. The fastest train as of 1999 - the <a href="http://www.o-keating.com/hsr/metroliner.htm">Metroliner</a> reaches a maximum commercial speed of 125 mph (slower by 25 mph, dang!). But, there are several fast trains out there, that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_train">go over 300 mph</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Automobiles will be cheaper than horses</strong></p>

<p>No comment. (I am trying to negotiate a deal with a local honda dealer - P.s: You guys areÂ great!)</p>

<p><strong>Everybody will walk ten miles</strong></p>

<p>It feels like it without a car.</p>

<p><strong>To England in two days</strong></p>

<p>I found a very interesting site, that talks about <a href="http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/performance/q0152.shtml">planes, fuel efficiency and flight times</a> between New York and London.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/performance/q0152.shtml"><img src="http://blog.shiv.me/images/cruise-comparison.gif" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Fight Time is the time taken by different aircrafts to fly between New York and London. Interesting to see that only two of the above are currently operational -Â the Boeing 747 and the F-15 Eagle. With the other two retired, a human being will have to sit for over 7 hours in a sealed coffin to reach London.</p>

<p><strong>There will be air-ships</strong></p>

<p>See above picture or google &ldquo;aircraft&rdquo; or &ldquo;planes&rdquo;. (no link for you, lazy bum)</p>

<p><strong>Aerial War ships and forts on wheels</strong></p>

<p>We have the most unimaginative names for them, planes and tanks?! How cool is &ldquo;forts on wheels&rdquo;?!</p>

<p><strong>There will be no wild animals</strong></p>

<p>Well, we are almost there. I guess in another 20 to 30 years we will surely achieve this goal/vision. (Do ya see me smiling at this one?!)</p>

<p><strong>Man will see around the world</strong></p>

<p>He was talking about google&rsquo;s sight-seeing man!</p>

<p><strong>Telephones around the world</strong></p>

<p><strong>Grand opera will be telephoned</strong></p>

<p><strong>How children will be taught</strong></p>

<p>The will not be taught. They will be hypnotized into zombies, roaming around the world pursuing pointless objectives. That&rsquo;s what 100 years can do to the human race (I&rsquo;m feeling itchy today)</p>

<p><strong>Store purchases by tubes</strong></p>

<p><strong>Vegetables grown by electricity</strong></p>

<p><strong>Oranges will grow in Philadelphia</strong></p>

<p><strong>Strawberries as large as apples</strong></p>

<p><strong>Peas as large as beets</strong></p>

<p><strong>Black, Blue and Green Roses</strong></p>

<p>What&rsquo;s with the predictions about food and flowers?! We have delegated these activities to the faceless farmer. (I haven&rsquo;t seen one in years). For all I know, the food that I eat is being grown in mars, and arrives on my table through a disruption in the sub-space continuum.</p>

<p><strong>Few drugs will be swallowed</strong></p>

<p>Nada on this one. Sorry. We have invented so many more drugs that we humans continue to swallow pills at an incredible pace. We even have new <a href="http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/5643204-description.html">patents on pill swallowing</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Oct 20, 2007</span>
        <p>I recently got myself a Canon 40D. After a 3 year wait, I can finally afford to buy myself a DSLR, and have been going crazy with it for the last couple of weeks.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.zooomr.com/photos/shiva/3534868/"><img src="http://blog.shiv.me/images/3534868_87dae6bac0.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://static.zooomr.com/images/3534868_87dae6bac0_b.jpg">larger version.</a></p>

<p>Largely influenced by <a href="http://thomashawk.com/">Thomas Hawk&rsquo;s</a> <a href="http://thomashawk.com/2007/09/principles-and-guidelines-for-modern.html">passion</a>, I have started carrying the camera everywhere I go: to work, when I go shopping, and even when I am just walking around the neighbourhood. I shot this picture, on my back from work, last Friday. With all the shooting, I am running out of HDD space very quickly. I am ok, for the next month (I have 2 external 80GB HDD + around 60GB in my laptop). After that, I will need to move the old ones to DVDs (something, which I hate doing: easy to lose shots, and difficult to retrieve).</p>

<p>Any suggestions are welcome (If anyone is reading this!). Oh.. I almost forgot,</p>

        <span class="post-date">Tue, Oct 9, 2007</span>
        <p>Dang! I got stung today, by a bee, for the first time in my life. The little critter was trying to sniff some aroma from the back of my head, and I reached out with my hand, grabbed him (sorry, it must of hurt), and he got pissed and wanked me. Just as any normal, crazed-out geek would do, the first thing I did was to <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?q=remedy+bee+sting&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a">search the net</a> for home-grown, bee sting remedies and I found <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2088863/">this</a> post by William Brantley. Being a much braver individual than I can be (when it comes to bee stings), he went through a series of bee-biting to test various remedies, that exists in the market-place and several home-grown remedies.
&gt;
&gt; So, how did the home remedies stack up against the pharmaceutical offerings? It depends on the home, I guess. The worst home remedies were worse than the worst pharmaceuticals, and the best home remedies better than the best pharmaceuticals. The Caladryl was the sole pharmaceutical remedy I&rsquo;d use again. If I had to leave the house to go get it, though, I&rsquo;d buy the meat tenderizer instead and use it in the vinegar/baking soda paste. Yet why bother with either of those when you already use, on a daily basis, the two best bee sting remedies? The winners<strong>: toothpaste and ice.</strong>
&gt;</p>

<p>I am going to test the above two, and let you know the results. I am hoping that they work their magic. Oooo.. that hurts! and again!</p>

<p>Update: I don&rsquo;t know about the toothpaste, but the ice definitely works!! I can&rsquo;t feel my finger (forget the sting), after icing it for 30 mins.</p>

        <h1 class="post-title"><a href="http://blog.shiv.me/2007/10/04/banking-woes/">Banking woes</a></h1>
        <span class="post-date">Thu, Oct 4, 2007</span>
        

<p>First off, this is a rant. You have been warned.</p>

<p>I have been banking with ICICI bank for the last 6 years. I have generally had a pleasant experience banking with them, since you could do pretty much everything you want to do with your account through their online interface. With my recent move to Canada, I was pleased to see an branch here in Vancouver.</p>

<p>I opened an account with them last week, and had used a check to make the initial deposit. A week passed and with no sign of a confirmation of account activation, I called their call center.</p>

<p><strong>Call 1:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Customer care executive(CCE): Good morning, ICICI bank, how may I help you?<br />
Me: Hi, I&rsquo;m Shivanand and I opened an account with you last week. I see that my cheque has been cleared, and I haven&rsquo;t received any confirmation of the same. I would like to know the status of my application?<br />
CCE: Can you give me your First Name, Last Name and Phone No?<br />
Me: <I give them the info\><br />
CCE: I&rsquo;m sorry I am unable to see a record of your account. Do you have your Customer Identification No?<br />
Me: I don&rsquo;t. I will call you back</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I had left all the documents at home, and had to call the next day.</p>

<p><strong>Call 2:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Me: <I give him, my First Name, Last Name, Cust ID, my dog's name, and the exact dimensions of the turd left by my dog yesterday, in the park)  
Cust ID: I am sorry, I can't find your account. Can I take a request from you, to send a request to ask for information from your branch?  
Me: umm... what? Whatever, how long will it take to know the status of my application?  
Cust Id<in a very loud voice\>: I can send a request to my back office, and it will take 2 days.<br />
Me:Why?<br />
Cust Id<in a very loud voice\>: I have to send it to my back office and it will take 2 days.<br />
Me: Why? I called the local bank, why can&rsquo;t you just forward me to the local branch, and I will ask them?<br />
Cust ID: We don&rsquo;t have that information?<br />
Me: whatever.. <and I put the phone down\></p>
</blockquote>

<p>With billions of dollars worth of technology, in the banking systems in the world, banks can&rsquo;t afford to forward a call to a specific branch, to ask for a some information? I find that absurd, and downright stupid. I am trying to give you business and the first experience I get is inability to tell me why you&rsquo;ve taken my money, but not activated my account?! If such is the level of incompetence, how well can you take care of my money?!!</p>

<p>Well, being fed up with call centers, I decided to call the branch itself. I called in, using the branch&rsquo;s number, and someone at the branch picked it up. She got my Cust ID, and my phone number, and said, she will call me in half hour. End of call and I am actually happy that I got the thing moving! That was simple, wasn&rsquo;t it? I spent 2 minutes, and got more confidence than a 20 minute conversation with a call center employee, who just doesn&rsquo;t care enough about the customer.</p>

<p>I also sent, this mail to ICICI customer care.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hi,<br />
I recently opened an account with ICICI bank Canada (I have been a ICICI bank customer for the last 6 years in India) and have not received confirmation of account activation. I tried calling your call center and was faced with a shouting employee. I found like to refrain from mentioning the person by name. Please educate your call center employees, that as a customer, I have not interest in the limitations that you have in your back office.<br />
I gave the employee my First name, last name and my customer identification number, and all he could give me was that my account was not active. (which is why I was calling). Also, remember this is after ICICI bank had withdrawn $5000 from my account (I gave a cheque for the initial deposit) a week back. I think it would be best if you can sensitize your employees on the ethics of phone conversation and also try and provide a solution rather than try and get rid of the call.<br />
I usually make it public, when I rant about something and have posted this mail on my blog. Click on the link below. I would expect a response from you, either through mail, or on my website.<br />

<p>I will post the replies here. Let&rsquo;s see if ICICI is agile enough.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Tue, Oct 2, 2007</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.twitbin.com/">Twitbin</a> has been my favourite client for twitter. the key thing that attracted me to it, was that I can use twitter, along side my browsing, and that makes life much simpler. Also, it have a very simple interface, to track your friends and their messages.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.screencast.com/t/K4HLLD1WkGy"><img src="http://blog.shiv.me/images/issuewithtwitbin.png" alt="issue-with-twitbin" /></a></p>

<p>I realized how much it mean to my twittering experience, when it went down sometime last week. I presumed, it was due to the upgrades that the twitter team was planning, and want to see if the problem persists. Well, looks like twitter is working fine now, through the web-interface, and I guess twitbin should be operational now, but.. well NO.. I still have to use the web interface and it suck big time.</p>

<p>Just click on the image, on the side, to see a screencast of how I try to use twit-bin and the errors.</p>

<p>that brings us to the next very cool tool I have been using. It&rsquo;s called <a href="http://www.jingproject.com/">Jing</a>, and it does screen captures. If you are a screen capture addict like myself, you need this tool. Another very neat thing with this tool, is that it allows you to capture only a small portion of the screen (you can select it), and do, either an image capture or a screencast recording on that selected area. Very nice for showing your users, how to use your software or to help your mom do something.</p>

<p>They also provide a <a href="http://www.screencast.com/">service, where you can host your screencast</a>, and it is free for 200MB storage and 1 GB bandwidth.</p>
