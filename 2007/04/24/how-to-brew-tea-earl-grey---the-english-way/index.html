    <div class="article-content">
      <p>I&rsquo;ve been on a reading binge lately. With quite a few hours of flying time, and long waits at airport lounges, I got the chance to catch up on my reading. Went through two books this time around, the placid, but mildly interesting <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Namesake-Novel-Jhumpa-Lahiri/dp/0395927218">&ldquo;The Namesake&rdquo; by Jhumpa Lahiri</a> (skip the book and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0433416/">watch the movie</a>.. way better) and the exhilariting final masterpiece, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Salmon-Doubt-Hitchhiking-Galaxy-Last/dp/1400045088">&ldquo;The Salmon of Doubt&rdquo;,</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Salmon_of_Doubt">wikipedia entry here</a>) by the new age, space comic, <a href="http://www.douglasadams.com/">Douglas</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Adams">Adams</a>.</p>

<p>The Salmon, is a collection of various bits of Douglas&rsquo; writing, and it reveals the quirky, and funny guy that he was. I couldn&rsquo;t resist putting this anecdote online (although it might be breaching some copyright - so please don&rsquo;t copy it any further and if someone wants to take this down, just drop me a comment)</p>

<p><strong>How to brew Tea - Douglas Adams</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Go to Marks and Spencer and by a packet of Earl Grey tea.</li>
<li>Go back to where you are staying and boil a kettle of water.</li>
<li>While it is coming to boil, open the sealed packet and sniff.</li>
<li>Careful - you may feel a bit dizzy, but this is in fact perfectly legal.</li>
<li>When the kettle has boiled, pour a little of it into a teapot, swirl it around , and tip it out again.</li>
<li>Put a couple (or three, depending on the size of the pot) of tea bags into the pot. (If I was really trying to lead you into the paths of righteousness, I would tell you to use free leaves rather than bags, but let&rsquo;s take this in easy stages.)</li>
<li>Bring the kettle back upto a boil, and then pour the boiling water as quickly as you can into the pot.</li>
<li>Let it stand for two or three minutes, and then pour it into a cup.</li>
</ol>

<p>He continues, &ldquo;Some will tell you that you shouldn&rsquo;t have milk with Earl Grey, just a slice of lemon. Screw them. I like it with milk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>now, there it is. That&rsquo;s how you make a wonderful pot of tea for yourself. Earl Grey at that - the English Way. And, what do you know, he likes it with milk, just like I do! Now, go make yourself a pot of tea and sip at it!!</p>
