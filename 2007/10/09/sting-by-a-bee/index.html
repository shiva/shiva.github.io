      <p>Dang! I got stung today, by a bee, for the first time in my life. The little critter was trying to sniff some aroma from the back of my head, and I reached out with my hand, grabbed him (sorry, it must of hurt), and he got pissed and wanked me. Just as any normal, crazed-out geek would do, the first thing I did was to <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?q=remedy+bee+sting&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a">search the net</a> for home-grown, bee sting remedies and I found <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2088863/">this</a> post by William Brantley. Being a much braver individual than I can be (when it comes to bee stings), he went through a series of bee-biting to test various remedies, that exists in the market-place and several home-grown remedies.
&gt;
&gt; So, how did the home remedies stack up against the pharmaceutical offerings? It depends on the home, I guess. The worst home remedies were worse than the worst pharmaceuticals, and the best home remedies better than the best pharmaceuticals. The Caladryl was the sole pharmaceutical remedy I&rsquo;d use again. If I had to leave the house to go get it, though, I&rsquo;d buy the meat tenderizer instead and use it in the vinegar/baking soda paste. Yet why bother with either of those when you already use, on a daily basis, the two best bee sting remedies? The winners<strong>: toothpaste and ice.</strong>
&gt;</p>

<p>I am going to test the above two, and let you know the results. I am hoping that they work their magic. Oooo.. that hurts! and again!</p>

<p>Update: I don&rsquo;t know about the toothpaste, but the ice definitely works!! I can&rsquo;t feel my finger (forget the sting), after icing it for 30 mins.</p>
