  <h1 class="post-title">Banking woes</h1>
  <span class="post-date">Thu, Oct 4, 2007</span>
  

<p>First off, this is a rant. You have been warned.</p>

<p>I have been banking with ICICI bank for the last 6 years. I have generally had a pleasant experience banking with them, since you could do pretty much everything you want to do with your account through their online interface. With my recent move to Canada, I was pleased to see an branch here in Vancouver.</p>

<p>I opened an account with them last week, and had used a check to make the initial deposit. A week passed and with no sign of a confirmation of account activation, I called their call center.</p>

<p><strong>Call 1:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Customer care executive(CCE): Good morning, ICICI bank, how may I help you?<br />
Me: Hi, I&rsquo;m Shivanand and I opened an account with you last week. I see that my cheque has been cleared, and I haven&rsquo;t received any confirmation of the same. I would like to know the status of my application?<br />
CCE: Can you give me your First Name, Last Name and Phone No?<br />
Me: <I give them the info\><br />
CCE: I&rsquo;m sorry I am unable to see a record of your account. Do you have your Customer Identification No?<br />
Me: I don&rsquo;t. I will call you back</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I had left all the documents at home, and had to call the next day.</p>

<p><strong>Call 2:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Me: <I give him, my First Name, Last Name, Cust ID, my dog's name, and the exact dimensions of the turd left by my dog yesterday, in the park)  
Cust ID: I am sorry, I can't find your account. Can I take a request from you, to send a request to ask for information from your branch?  
Me: umm... what? Whatever, how long will it take to know the status of my application?  
Cust Id<in a very loud voice\>: I can send a request to my back office, and it will take 2 days.<br />
Me:Why?<br />
Cust Id<in a very loud voice\>: I have to send it to my back office and it will take 2 days.<br />
Me: Why? I called the local bank, why can&rsquo;t you just forward me to the local branch, and I will ask them?<br />
Cust ID: We don&rsquo;t have that information?<br />
Me: whatever.. <and I put the phone down\></p>
</blockquote>

<p>With billions of dollars worth of technology, in the banking systems in the world, banks can&rsquo;t afford to forward a call to a specific branch, to ask for a some information? I find that absurd, and downright stupid. I am trying to give you business and the first experience I get is inability to tell me why you&rsquo;ve taken my money, but not activated my account?! If such is the level of incompetence, how well can you take care of my money?!!</p>

<p>Well, being fed up with call centers, I decided to call the branch itself. I called in, using the branch&rsquo;s number, and someone at the branch picked it up. She got my Cust ID, and my phone number, and said, she will call me in half hour. End of call and I am actually happy that I got the thing moving! That was simple, wasn&rsquo;t it? I spent 2 minutes, and got more confidence than a 20 minute conversation with a call center employee, who just doesn&rsquo;t care enough about the customer.</p>

<p>I also sent, this mail to ICICI customer care.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hi,<br />
I recently opened an account with ICICI bank Canada (I have been a ICICI bank customer for the last 6 years in India) and have not received confirmation of account activation. I tried calling your call center and was faced with a shouting employee. I found like to refrain from mentioning the person by name. Please educate your call center employees, that as a customer, I have not interest in the limitations that you have in your back office.<br />
I gave the employee my First name, last name and my customer identification number, and all he could give me was that my account was not active. (which is why I was calling). Also, remember this is after ICICI bank had withdrawn $5000 from my account (I gave a cheque for the initial deposit) a week back. I think it would be best if you can sensitize your employees on the ethics of phone conversation and also try and provide a solution rather than try and get rid of the call.<br />
I usually make it public, when I rant about something and have posted this mail on my blog. Click on the link below. I would expect a response from you, either through mail, or on my website.<br />

<p>I will post the replies here. Let&rsquo;s see if ICICI is agile enough.</p>
