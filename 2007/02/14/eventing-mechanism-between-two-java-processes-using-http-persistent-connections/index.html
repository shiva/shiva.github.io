      <p>I have been twidling with HTTP Persistent connections in the last few weeks. Let me start at the beginning</p>

<p>I needed to replace CORBA in a legacy application with something new. Ofcourse, there are a few alternatives out there, but I needed something very lightweight. The problem had two major parts</p>

<ol>
<li>Command Execution - Let the client, execute a function on the server-side and process the output data</li>
<li>Eventing - Make clients register for events and wait until some events occur and the server transmits the required objects to the client side.</li>
</ol>

<p>The Command execution was simple. Expose all services provided by the server as SOAP services and make the clients talk SOAP/XML, however SOAP involves a lot of overhead in terms of serialising the object into an XML stream and later decoding that. Since both the client and server were completely in Java, I just had to transport the Java object itself<br />
The event part, however, provided a challenge. I had restrictions on opening ports on the clients (Issues like firewalls, NAT, SSL support etc etc). So I chose to use HTTP itself to do eventing.</p>

<p>So how do we do that?!</p>

<p>You will need a servlet container like Tomcat. Tomcat supports HTTP 1.1 connections and sends a keep-alive until the servlet servicing is complete. Doing eventing requires the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>The connection between client and server should remain for the entire life of the client or server (whichever is shorter ;) )</li>
<li>Both ends should listen at the ends of the connection for any event.</li>
<li>Server should have an eventing mechanism to forward events to the required clients.</li>
</ol>
