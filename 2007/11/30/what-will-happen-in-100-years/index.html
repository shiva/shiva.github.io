  <h1 class="post-title">What will happen in 100 years?</h1>
  <span class="post-date">Fri, Nov 30, 2007</span>
  <p>That is a very difficult question to answer (which I don&rsquo;t answer anywhere in this post: go away). Anyone who attempts to do so, must be a genius or a fool, perhaps a little of both. <a href="http://blogoscoped.com/google-blog.html">Philipp Lenssen</a> on <a href="http://blogoscoped.com/">Google Blogoscoped</a>, observes how one of those is true. Here is a more detailed analysis.</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.shiv.me/images/3836395_b29aee123a.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>John Watkins, must have been quite a visionary considering the depth of his predictions and how much of it has come true.</p>

<p><strong>Five hundred Million people</strong></p>

<p>He was right about that, but under-estimated the human ability and eagerness to reproduce (and migrate). Based on the <a href="http://www.census.gov/main/www/popclock.html">US census 2000</a>,Â  the US now has over 300 million inhabitants (that is excluding all the people on H, L and BÂ Visas)</p>

<p><strong>The American will be taller</strong></p>

<p>According to <a href="http://www.halls.md/on/men-height-o.htm">this website</a>, the average height of the American male is somewhere between 160 to 180 cms. Now, since he hasn&rsquo;t provided a figure, there is no way to validate this information.</p>

<p><strong>There will be no C, X or Q</strong></p>

<p>Hmm.. I did a few searches for words starting with C:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.findtheword.info/resultat.php?stype=begins&amp;sword=C">findtheword.info</a> = 47831</p>

<p><a href="http://wordhut.com/browse/c/1.htm">wordhut.com</a> = 274 pages of 51 words each (13974)</p>

<p>Needless to say, these are just ones that start with one of the letters he mentions. It ain&rsquo;t happening anytime soon.</p>

<p><strong>Hot and Cold Air from Spigots</strong></p>

<p>A <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=home+heating+systems&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a">search for &lsquo;home heating systems&rsquo;</a> on google gave about 33 million results in 0.15 seconds. Thankfully, we are way ahead of what someone a hundred years ago could imagine, how we would heat ourselves.</p>

<p><strong>No mosquitoes or flies</strong></p>

<p>Not much of a change there (although, if you are reading this, then you probably live in a place will lesser mosquitoes than 100 years back)</p>

<p>One thing, I bet he never, in his wildest dreams, would have conceived was that we will have patents for <a href="http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/5733552-description.html">mosquito repellents</a></p>

<p><strong>Ready-cooked meals</strong></p>

<p>We have found a million ways to feed ourselves, and this includes fast-food, and packaged dinners and Martha Stewart&rsquo;s. Sweet Success!</p>

<p><strong>No foods will be exposed</strong></p>

<p>In the US, maybe, but there are still quite a few places in the world, where this is not erradicated (hint: take a flight to India and visit Arcot Road, Chennai, Tamil Nadu - also take life-insurance before you go (I can be your nominee - use the contact form for such purposes or <a href="http://twitter.com/shvelmur">tweet me</a>.))</p>

<p><strong>Coal will not be used for heating or cooking</strong></p>

<p>Woot! Woot! Google, good for ye. You are trying to do what someone thought of 100 years back. Go tidal power.</p>

<p><strong>There will be no street cars in our large cities</strong></p>

<p>Yeah right.</p>

<p><strong>Photographs will be telegraphed</strong></p>

<p>2 cheers here. We even went a step further and invented this thingy called the internet, and we actually <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/shvelmur">have</a> <a href="http://zooomr.com/photos/shiva">quite</a> a few <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=photo+sharing">sites</a> (about 100,000)Â out there helping us do this. (big business these days uh?)</p>

<p><strong>Trains @ 150 miles/hour</strong></p>

<p>Sadly, the US has moved away from trains and on to air-traffic in the last 100 years. The fastest train as of 1999 - the <a href="http://www.o-keating.com/hsr/metroliner.htm">Metroliner</a> reaches a maximum commercial speed of 125 mph (slower by 25 mph, dang!). But, there are several fast trains out there, that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_train">go over 300 mph</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Automobiles will be cheaper than horses</strong></p>

<p>No comment. (I am trying to negotiate a deal with a local honda dealer - P.s: You guys areÂ great!)</p>

<p><strong>Everybody will walk ten miles</strong></p>

<p>It feels like it without a car.</p>

<p><strong>To England in two days</strong></p>

<p>I found a very interesting site, that talks about <a href="http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/performance/q0152.shtml">planes, fuel efficiency and flight times</a> between New York and London.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/performance/q0152.shtml"><img src="http://blog.shiv.me/images/cruise-comparison.gif" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Fight Time is the time taken by different aircrafts to fly between New York and London. Interesting to see that only two of the above are currently operational -Â the Boeing 747 and the F-15 Eagle. With the other two retired, a human being will have to sit for over 7 hours in a sealed coffin to reach London.</p>

<p><strong>There will be air-ships</strong></p>

<p>See above picture or google &ldquo;aircraft&rdquo; or &ldquo;planes&rdquo;. (no link for you, lazy bum)</p>

<p><strong>Aerial War ships and forts on wheels</strong></p>

<p>We have the most unimaginative names for them, planes and tanks?! How cool is &ldquo;forts on wheels&rdquo;?!</p>

<p><strong>There will be no wild animals</strong></p>

<p>Well, we are almost there. I guess in another 20 to 30 years we will surely achieve this goal/vision. (Do ya see me smiling at this one?!)</p>

<p><strong>Man will see around the world</strong></p>

<p>He was talking about google&rsquo;s sight-seeing man!</p>

<p><strong>Telephones around the world</strong></p>

<p><strong>Grand opera will be telephoned</strong></p>

<p><strong>How children will be taught</strong></p>

<p>The will not be taught. They will be hypnotized into zombies, roaming around the world pursuing pointless objectives. That&rsquo;s what 100 years can do to the human race (I&rsquo;m feeling itchy today)</p>

<p><strong>Store purchases by tubes</strong></p>

<p><strong>Vegetables grown by electricity</strong></p>

<p><strong>Oranges will grow in Philadelphia</strong></p>

<p><strong>Strawberries as large as apples</strong></p>

<p><strong>Peas as large as beets</strong></p>

<p><strong>Black, Blue and Green Roses</strong></p>

<p>What&rsquo;s with the predictions about food and flowers?! We have delegated these activities to the faceless farmer. (I haven&rsquo;t seen one in years). For all I know, the food that I eat is being grown in mars, and arrives on my table through a disruption in the sub-space continuum.</p>

<p><strong>Few drugs will be swallowed</strong></p>

<p>Nada on this one. Sorry. We have invented so many more drugs that we humans continue to swallow pills at an incredible pace. We even have new <a href="http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/5643204-description.html">patents on pill swallowing</a>.</p>
