        <p>Well I confess, I&rsquo;m a tool fanatic . Before you get werid ideas let me tell you that what I mean is that I like to use small, efficient utilities, that help me get my work done quickly. I have been on a perpetual hunt for <strong>THE</strong> best utility for almost all tasks.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Tue, Apr 19, 2005</span>
        <p>Yup, been a very long time since I blogged!! but I am back again!<br />
**Thanks to my fellow util-seeker Sudhin for this bit of news<br />
**</p>

<p>Adobe Systems Incorporated (Nasdaq: ADBE) has announced a definitive agreement to acquire Macromedia (Nasdaq: MACR) in an all-stock transaction valued at approximately $3.4 billion. Under the terms of the agreement, which has been approved by both boards of directors, Macromedia stockholders will receive, at a fixed exchange ratio, 0.69 shares of Adobe common stock for every share of Macromedia common stock in a tax-free exchange. Based on Adob &rsquo;s and Macromedia&rsquo;s closing prices on Friday April 15, 2005, this represents a price of $41.86 per share of Macromedia common stock.</p>

<p>The combination of Adobe and Macromedia strengthens our mission of helping people and organizations communicate better. Through the combination of our powerful development, authoring and collaboration tools &ndash; and the complementary functionality of PDF and Flash &ndash; we have the opportunity to drive an industry-defining technology platform that delivers compelling, rich content and applications across a wide range of devices and operating systems.</p>

<p>By combining the passion and creativity of two leading-edge companies, we will continue driving innovations that are changing the ways people everywhere are experiencing and interacting with information.</p>

<p>What willl happen to FrameMaker, DreamWeaver, Flash and the other good technologies?</p>

        <span class="post-date">Mon, Mar 7, 2005</span>
        <p>Started reading &ldquo;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0440204887/102-0930866-9836102" title="Illusions">Illusions</a>&rdquo; by Richard Bach. Often, I feel, that a book comes in your life, when you are ready for it. It presents itself, in ways you never would have imagined. I have heard of this book for the last 10 years. There has been a sopy at my parent&rsquo;s place (where I stayed for the better part of the last 10 years) and it never occured to me, to pick that small book (of about 200 odd pages) and give it a read.</p>

<p>This weekend has been a little disturbing, and when I was there lounging in my hall, on a Sturday hot afternoon, something caught the corner of my eye. This small book was jutting out admist the pile of rubbish that I have come to collect. It was odd. It was as if it was beckoning me to pick it up.. Urging me towards itself, a weird, yet sensible and completely discernable gravity&hellip;</p>

<p>I finally gave in, snapping out of the half-slumber, I picked it up and as the pages unfolded, so did the solutions to my worries. It was as if, this book was written a good 3 decades ago, with the full knowledge that a soul such as myself would want it, would benefit from the contents (immensly). Long live the hope of fateful coincidences!</p>

        <p>[FIR of a virus on a phone][0]! A very warm welcome to the world of computing! Soon we will need antiviral software running on our phones all the time and that would mean that your phones will get more processing power. If phones take the way PCs have, the day when we will have a phone with a huge Pentium or whatever processor and tons of RAM won&rsquo;t be too far away.</p>

<p>A little over-engineering I say. Today, I can&rsquo;t get a system, that can do a bare minimum of tasks, everything has everything else built-in. This, of course, is a double edged sword! Although it helps to bring the cost down, I will end up paying for things that I might never use! What is the use of a graphics card (on-board intel810) for a system that I shall primarily use for word-processing, email and some browsing!</p>

        <span class="post-date">Thu, Feb 17, 2005</span>
        <p>What a lousy feeling it is, when you hold shares of a company, whose customer you have been for more than 2 years and have paid everyone of the bills in time, and when you have an issue, you are brushed under the carpet!That&rsquo;s what happened to me today.</p>

<p>I have been with Airtel (cell phone service provider in Chennai, India - for the uninitiated ;)) for the last two years. I had an automatic debit facility enabled. In January, the credit card I had enabled the auto-debit facility on expired. Airtel, promptly disabled the facility and disconnected my service asking me to call customer support. Well, I tried to do just that, but you know what?, the call to customer-care wouldn&rsquo;t go through coz they disconnected me!! Wonderful!</p>

<p>I travel to Pondicherry in the weekends, and incidentally it happened just after I boarded the bus on Friday. I managed to find an Airtel connect that was open on Saturday and paid my bill. However it took the whole of 3 working days to enable my account again! So much for being on a corporate plan!</p>

<p>Now comes the best part &hellip; (hold your breath ;) ). I wanted to enable the auto-debit again and guess what you need to do? This being the age of the paperless office, you need to fill a two page form (about 30-40 fields in all), attach a photocopy of your card and submit the form at Airtel connect or you have the option of calling your corporate customer care executive to collect it from your office. Now that seems simple enough&hellip; Except that it takes four calls to person concerned and loads of cajoling to get him in the vicinity of your office, but then ofcourse he/she chooses to disregard your plight and ignore you. After the ignominy of such sorts, you brave to drive to the nearest Airtel connect office, which incidentally has been so well dispersed across town, so as to avoid proximity to any office building! (Good design always pays off you see)</p>

<p>You get there, finally after the torture of Chennai&rsquo;s traffic (see my [old article on Chennai&rsquo;s traffic][0]) just to find out that you are late by 30 seconds and you have to do the whole trip again. By this time, you are so fed up that the guy across the counter decides to leave his seat coz it gets really hot with the steam that is the result of your brain getting cooked, thanks to the wonderful, delightful service rendered to you after paying your bills in time for the last two years, having invested in the company coz your thought it was professionally run!</p>

<p>What you learn out this life changing event - <strong>STOP USING CELLPHONES - THEY ARE INJURIOUS TO BODY AND MIND!</strong></p>

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Jan 22, 2005</span>
        <p>Today has been a very sad day. I bid farewell to Mr Subramaniam.</p>

<p>He was my grandfather&rsquo;s nephew and has been my a great inspiration to me in my life. One of the bravest and knowledgeable persons I have known. One who lived through life with conviction and was as clear at heart as they come.</p>

<p>He has always been there for my family at good and bad times.</p>

<p>A devout and practising Hindu, and a learned man in vedic chants, I have always envied him of having lived in my grandfather&rsquo;s company. I think, what I know about my grandpa, is what &ldquo;mani thatha&rdquo; (what I used to call him) has told me of. Having lived in the pre-independance era, he has offered many insights into the lives of my forefathers.</p>

<p>You shall be remembered and your words cherished forever in our hearts. I wish your soul to rest in peace. Adieu my dear &ldquo;mani thatha&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Could we see when and where we are to meet again, we would be more tender when we bid our friends goodbye.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><strong>&ndash; Marie Louise De La Ramee, [Ouida]</strong></p>

<p>This article by the former CEO of RIAA is quite intriguing. In today&rsquo;s world of <em>&ldquo;digital creativity&rdquo;</em>, are the copyright laws really as relevant as in yester-years? Does copyright laws curb creativity or are they in place for safegaurding the poor content creator from being cheated out of their pride possessions by 12-year-old, computer weilding school kids?!</p>

<p>Check it out!!! I love thee Google, &ldquo;Lord of Search&rdquo;!!</p>

<p>Really really neat way to access information. Very quick, a little scary considering that Google can go on to become the next MS! We the users of technology (particularly developers, testers etc) are going to have more exiciting times!!</p>

<p>Google Desktop is a like have the Google search engine installed for searching your system. it indexes your system, and ofcourse it currently supports only Microsoft products, but hope that a few of the open source software liek thunderbird and firefox are also supported soon.</p>

<p>Looking for that file that you know is about something , but just can&rsquo;t remember where you put it on your system.. no probs, just load up a browser with GDesktop and it&rsquo;ll find it for you!</p>

        <p>Created a common blog site for my wife and me to blog on..</p>

<p>This blogging thingy is amazing&hellip;. it really let&rsquo;s people open up and be much more communicative and open minded with the rest of the world.</p>

<p>let us see how she piks up blogging.. I think it should create some interesting dialogues between the two of us&hellip;</p>

<p>and yeah&hellip; you should get your wife and/or girlfriend (;) .. don&rsquo;t let one know abt the other) to blog with you &hellip; is an interesting way of getting together on some activity and is not bound by time and location&hellip;</p>

<p>remember when your dad left notes for your mom on the refridgerator &hellip;I think it is the modern fridge note!!! ;)</p>

        <p>Well, are you really bored with life and have a net connection, but none of the sites do anything for you?!! Well, here is one nice site that caught my attention when I was googling (<em>= verb. searching aimlessly on google with anything that comes to your mind!</em>)</p>

<p>Neat interface and no &ldquo;signup with us if you want to use&rdquo; thingy, gives good trivia and lots of news about the Indian job scene (if you would care to look at it!)</p>
