    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2008/06/friendfeed-comments-for-wordpress">Friendfeed comments for wordpress</a></h1>

    <div id="post">
      <p>Conversations on the web have evolved quite a bit, in the last 4/5 years. During the late 90s, conversations on the web, was pretty much non-existant, except for a few, who used their websites to engage in conversations. The advent of the blog, made available tools to start and continue conversations. </p>
<p>In the last couple of years, there has been several attempts to normalize comments, across the blogging ecosystem, and several ways have been tried. <a href="http://disqus.com">Disqus</a>, is a company, that is in the business of aggregating comments for your blog. <a href="http://seesmic.com">Seesmic</a>, a video communications startup, has partnered with them to integrate video comments. Even after all of these innovations, getting people to comment on a blog, is still pretty difficult. </p>
<p>You need, </p>
<p>  - an engaged audience (the kind that wants to comment)</p>
<p>  - access to a critical mass of such people.</p>
<p>  - regular compelling content, to keep your masses.</p>
<p>  - friends who are A-listers, willing to quote or refer you to their audiences.</p>
<p>Now, with <a href="http://friendfeed.com/shivanand">Friendfeed</a>, I see a break away from these restrictions. All you need, is the willingness to be read and comment on a lot of people's content, which will enable a lot of people to follow you, which means you have their attention (one might argue the attention span is very less, but nonetheless, you have a chance).</p>
<p>Once you have a sizable following, all you need to do, is write that compelling content, that interests your followers (which should come by, as you comment more and more). Until now, to get people to visit your blog, your content has to compelling enough for them to leave the tool they used to discover your blog, and visit it, and then want to comment. Installing the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/friendfeed-comments/">worpdress plugin for friendfeed comments</a> removes that barrier too.</p>
<p>That is exactly what I have done. So, from now on, anyone who follows me in friendfeed, can leave a comment in FF, and it will be autmatically part of my comment stream (although, it is not fully integrated into my comment feed etc)</p>
<p>How kewl is that?!</p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2008/06/cvs-getting-list-of-files-changed-in-the-current-tree">cvs - Getting list of files changed in the current tree</a></h1>

    <div id="post">
      <p>The simple way to retreive the list of changed files would be to update the tree, which would then list the files updated.</p>
<p><code>#cvs update . &gt; filelist.dat</code></p>
<p>The problem with this, is that if there have been changes to other files after your last update, you will have to manually glean the files that you have changed. I tend face this, particularly during the last couple of weeks before a release, since you don't want to risk updating your tree everyday, but still have to make 2/3 checkins. I did some googling today, and found how to find the list of files changed without updating your tree.</p>
<p><code>#cvs -n update . &gt; filelist.dat</code></p>
<p>Thanks <a href="http://blog.jonnay.net/archives/181-Getting-a-list-of-changed-files-in-CVS-without-updating.html">Jonnay</a> for this. I should used man before I googled, but hey, I'm lazy today :)</p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2008/06/a-web-based-writer-for-writing-to-a-blog">A web based writer for writing to a blog?!</a></h1>

    <div id="post">
      <p><a href="http://writetomyblog.com/">WriteToMyBlog.com</a>, is a web-based editor (with a lot of formatting options), that allows you to write to your blog (from another website?!).</p>
<p>First thoughts go like,</p>
<p>"wtf?!", ... "hmmm.. interesting"... "I am a web 2.0 junkie?!</p>
<p><a title="writetomyblog-dot-com" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/22535384@N00/2551244392"><img src="/images/2551244392_1822e5a281.jpg" alt="writetomyblog-dot-com" /></a></p>
<p><strong>The likes</strong></p>
<p>1. Simplicity of the UI interface - neat, allows lots of space for text</p>
<p>2. Integration of Flickr and Youtube (although I would love to see more such services)</p>
<p>3. Zero account creation overhead. (I wrote this post, before I created the account to publish it, and is a 1-click process.)</p>
<p><strong>The dislikes</strong></p>
<p>1. No keyboard shortcuts.</p>
<p>2. Too many formatting options. I would rather have more external services (quote pownce or twitter conversations, facebook, vimeo and other photo and video sites)</p>
<p>3. popups (need I say more.. in this day and age.. popups for functionality is a sin ... almost).</p>
<p>4. A few irksome bugs. (undo doesn't work in-order, flickr requires login name, cursor disappears after including a picture.. etc)</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The service offers what should be part of any good bloggingsoftware. With recent improvements in Wordpress Dashboard and Editor, I doubt if this tool will be able to keep my attention for long. The whole concept of logging into one site for writing to another, seems a little weird. I don't really understand the use-case.</p>
<p><strong>Update: I found a few more bugs</strong></p>
<p>- Editing an existing post, ignore all previous indentation (white-space).</p>
<p>- Tags set are technocrati tags, and not wordpress tags (I guess this is more like a feature request than a bug)</p>
<p>I couldn't find a getsatifaction account for this tool, and hence have sent a traceback to their blog. Mark, if you come this way, do create and account for your product/company at <a href="http://getsatisfaction.com">getsatisfaction.com</a>, and do set up some form of bug tracking system, so that your users can be your testers :). Btw, you are welcome for the bugs mentioned here. Ohh.. btw.. I'm using Firefox on Mac OSX.</p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2008/05/so-long-and-thanks-for-all-the-good-times">So long and thanks for all the good times</a></h1>

    <div id="post">
      <p>I have been away from the internet for most of the last week. There are only a few things that can keep me away from spending hours reading feeds or uploading pictures, and when those things do happen, it is not very pleasant.</p>
<p>Last week I lost yet another wonderful person from my life. I lost my father-in-law, Mr. Ghanshyam Maheswari. He was a good man, a good soul, a great father, and most of all, someone who lived his life - truly lived every moment of it. I can't find words to express the loss I feel. As the hours on the plane ride half way across the world passed, I couldn't begin to accept that he had really passed on. I guess, a part of me was expecting to see him at the airport, telling my wife and me that this was all just a dream.</p>
<p>Life, and not death, is cruel. It makes us experience a lot of things that we could do without.  With the greatest regret and effort, I need to muster the ability to bid adieu, to a wonderful person that has enriched the lives of several who have been left behind. Mr Maheswari, may you find the big black table-tennis board in the sky. Keep a spot open, so we can finish the game we never played, when my time comes.</p>
<p>You can send your condolences either in this blog's comments or to the following</p>
