    <div class="article-content">
      <p>A friend asked what I like about google+, and as I started posting a reply , I noticed there were enough to make a blog post. So here goes&hellip;</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a quick list:<br />
1. Mobile app on android and iphone are awesome!<br />
2. Automatic upload of pics on phone/picasa<br />
3. Non-crappy photos (allows 2400+px, and g+ renders pictures better, since they don&rsquo;t mess with the image, if it is smaller than the max size)<br />
4. Easier to mention specific people in a conversation. (auto-completes ppl&rsquo;s profile name)<br />
5. hangouts (free video conferencing)<br />
6. Group messaging done right (huddle) on the mobile phone<br />
7. decent integration with email (I guess this is just coz I use Gmail)<br />
8. Privacy - predictable and manageable (not that it matters to me)<br />
9. Much less noise (a - mostly used by techies for now, b - allows asymmetric relationships Ã  la twitter)<br />
10. Keyboard shortcuts (J, K work. Someone at google like vi &ndash; a lot)</p>

<p>So, there&rsquo;s 10 reasons to dump Facebook for G+. There is a lot more in terms of features (new ones are added all the time), but mostly the community is awesome, and the engagement is better!</p>

<p>11. (bonus). I was going to say games, but they have that here too, but I&rsquo;m not bothered by it, and don&rsquo;t have to see someone&rsquo;s update on buying sheep</p>

<p>Having said the above, I miss a couple of FB &ldquo;features&rdquo;. Really, its the of the same: 1. There is no way to start a conversation with someone, unless, you address it specifically to that person (in which case nobody else see it). Facebook does this simply, by providing a &ldquo;wall&rdquo;.</p>

<p>2. There are no &ldquo;Groups&rdquo;. Ie each circle is local to me, and hence, if I want to have a group for all my friends from university, I will have to add them to a circle. In order to simulate Facebook &ldquo;groups&rdquo;, everyone in that circle, has to add everyone else to a group of the same name. Adding one more person to that group, now means that everyone has to add that person manually.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure, google will come up with something to address the above two. We&rsquo;ll have to wait and see how it goes!</p>
