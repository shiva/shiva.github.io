  <h1 class="post-title">People of GVRD - a photographic experiment</h1>
  <span class="post-date">Sun, Jul 24, 2011</span>
  <p>A couple of weeks ago I started a new project - to shoot random strangers in the streets of GVRD (Greater Vancouver Regional Districts - for those of you that are not from here). I wanted to see if I had the guts to walk up to random strangers, and ask their permission to shoot a picture of them. I was also curious to know how they would react to it, and what my success rate would be.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve asked around 14, and 8 said yes. Some of them were not comfortable with their pictures on the internets. I offered them 3 options.</p>

<ol>
<li>Pictures don&rsquo;t end up on the internet (emailed to them if they send me an email)</li>
<li>On the internet for non-commercial purposes.</li>
<li>On the internet in public domain.</li>
</ol>

<p>Only 2 were ok with public domain. The rest opted for option 2. One didn&rsquo;t want it on the internet at all.</p>

<p>It was an interesting experience, and I&rsquo;m looking forward to more such excursions. For the lack of a better name, I chose to call this project : <a href="http://blog.shiv.me/projects/people-of-gvrd/">People of GVRD</a>.</p>

<p>Suggestions are welcome. Do you have a better name for the project? Perhaps, thoughts on how I should approach people. Do you think I&rsquo;m insane? Apart from photos, would you be interested in a short blurb about the person? What would you like to know?</p>
