      <p>to write a blog post, when someone calls you to tell you that they checked your blog, and there was nothing of interest. Ofcourse, being lazy, I just chose to put some pictures, which have been languishing in the netherworld of pictures on the internet &ndash; Picasa.
Looks like, Google has improved picasaweb to be almost usable. It is still void of comments, or any real social aspect. I&rsquo;m still well within the free quota, and I&rsquo;m not forking out money for yet another storage provider, until they provide a way to export all of the content that I generate in a &ldquo;parseable&rdquo; form (That&rsquo;s right, we invent words here).</p>

      <p>Since my last post, I&rsquo;ve had a couple of replies, a few more tweets, and few minutes of talking about unsigned types in Java, and why it doesn&rsquo;t support them.
I still retail the view that unsigned types are unnecessary for the majority of Java developers. The only kind that should care, are those who deal with network information (like representing an ipaddress or macaddress). Everyone, put down your forks, and do not touch the unsigned.</p>

      <p>An interesting thing for me, is that if I am active on twitter during daytime in India (now that I&rsquo;m here on vacation), I get to have some interesting conversations about design and development. Today, I chanced to talk about the lack of unsigned values support in Java.

      <p>I&rsquo;ve been busy. That doesn&rsquo;t explain my silence on this blog, its but an excuse. A lot of things have been happening, both in my personal and professional life, and I&rsquo;m not at liberty to talk about them. Those are for another day.
I have been writing code - for money, ie - for 9 years now. This obsession started a good 6 years before that. I don&rsquo;t have much to show for it (most of it is copyrighted, or lost across several machines, that weren&rsquo;t mine).</p>
