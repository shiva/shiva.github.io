        <span class="post-date">Fri, Aug 19, 2005</span>
        <p>OBL - Out about learning, the second time to the same place, same people, but totally a new experience. On a deeper note, I rediscovered myself! Quite a few things about myself, that I hadn&rsquo;t noticed before came to light.</p>

<p>I had a great time too, meeting a few new people, and a few new versions of old ones!<br />
The day we were returning to Chennai, we went to a kewl pub called &ldquo;Alibi&rdquo; in Church Street, where we managed to get two free pitchers of beer (try the Castle beer there &hellip; really neat!)</p>

<p>I am in the process of selecting and uploading some photos. Comeback later for the url</p>

        <span class="post-date">Fri, Jul 29, 2005</span>
        <p>I&rsquo;m at office, after an all-nighter! I chanced to come by this amazing un-put-downable book by name &ldquo;Five point someone&rdquo; by Chetan Bhagat (Check out <a href="http://www.fivepointsomeone.com">the book&rsquo;s site</a>). Not many books that I read get read, in a day.The amazing story of three friends through life at IIT, brought back memories that had been shelved for the past four years. Of the gazillion trees that were felled for the books I have bought, read and enjoyed, the trees that made this book lost their lives to a worthy cause.</p>

<p>Bhagat, hats off to you, for<br />
- putting a smile on my face<br />
- kindling some of the fond memories of collegiate life<br />
- Hari, Alok and Ryan, my friends for a lifetime<br />
- being such a gifted writer<br />
- getting me back in touch with life</p>

<p>There.. I&rsquo;m a five pointer too! ;)</p>

        <p>I encountered, by far, the sickest website I have seen in my entire life.<br />
Kittyculture is the act of stuffing a sweet little kitten into a jar, sealing its anus shut and feeding it to a tube, and keeping it that way for 4 weeks and more, so that it may be given &ldquo;fair&rdquo; treatment by giving it an &ldquo;unique&rdquo; shape that nature has denied it!! Wow, I just read what I wrote and the absurdity just baffles me! How can anyone in their sane mind can even dream up something like this!!</p>

<p>I personally feel very ashamed having to link to this site, but do so with great melancholy, just so that you can see it too, and sign this petition and stop it.</p>

<p>Please do visit it <a href="http://www.bonsaikitten.com/">here</a>, but only for the purpose of understanding how heinous man has become! How torturous we are towards our fellow creatures that nature has created.</p>

<p>and sign the petition against it <a href="http://www.thepetitionsite.com/takeaction/375646989">here</a></p>

        <span class="post-date">Fri, Jul 15, 2005</span>
        <p>We went for team-lunch at this amazing restaurant called &ldquo;Kadaleevanam&rdquo;. It is a health food restau, at Mugappair, Chennai. The food there is based on naturopathic principles and it actually tasted quite good. They explain the food that you eat, and enforce (read, beware of the order in which you eat, or else they&rsquo;ll make you eat it again ;) ). A small tip, check out the ice-creams there (Yup, healthy ice-cream!! quite an oxy-moron eh?! ). Quite an interesting choice of ice-creams, like tender-coconut, ginger and honey, guava!</p>

<p>Remember to reserve your spot there atleast a day ahead, coz the food is freshly prepared and no refrigeration and reheating. It is a must try if you are in Chennai. You can check out their site at <a href="http://www.cholayilsanjeevanam.com">here</a></p>

        <p>What are the odds of meeting a violinst and a chartered accountant (two people, ofcourse ;) ) in the same city on the same day, at the same cafe? Well, I did just that. I&rsquo;m sorry to say that I managed to forget the name of this very interesting violinst, who educated me at the finese of Bach&rsquo;s compositions and also taught me a coupla chords on the guitar (Aparently he plays that too!! )</p>

<p>Well, I also met this kewl dude (deprived of rock since he arrived in Chennai). He calls himself Nitin, and is studying to be a chartered accountant. (Yo Nitin.. there I kept my promise.. I blogged about you).</p>

<p>Finally, I managed to drag my butt outta office before 10 PM. Let&rsquo;s hope this keeps up!</p>

        <span class="post-date">Tue, Jul 5, 2005</span>
        <p>I booked a swift this weekend. Seems like it will take almost 5 months for delivery! I hate this BS dished by Maruti to its customers. Why introduce a car, which is by far the most economical in its class, packed with features and expect it to sell only 5000 a month?! Well, the sales rep at a Maruti Dealer told me the production capacity was just 5000 a month, and they already have booking close to 30000?!</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t fathom how such a blunder can be made by a company that is considered to be at the forefront of the Indian auto industry. It is quite irritating, having to wait for 5 months, but I&rsquo;m sure the end product is work the wait! Itching to get my hands on those wheels!</p>

        <p>Law 1.Every Software Engineer continues his state of chatting or forwarding mails unless he is assigned work by external unbalanced manager.<br />
Law 2. The rate of change in the software is directly proportional to the payment received from client and takes place at the quick rate as when deadline force is applied.<br />
Law 3. For every Use Case Manifestation there is an equal but opposite Software Implementation.<br />
Law 4. Bugs can neither be created nor be removed from software by a developer. It can only be converted from one form to another. The total number of bugs in the software always remains constant.</p>

        <p>I took the Swift for a test drive last weekend. Amazing feeling I must say! The gear changes are soo slick, spot on .. like a hot knife through table butter!<br />
The acceleration is smooth, and yet let&rsquo;s you know it is there if you want to leave in a hurry. Perfect seating position for me (I&rsquo;m 6&rsquo;5&rdquo;).</p>

<p>The vehicle took my heart away. It&rsquo;s now a Swift or nothing at all! I&rsquo;m booking it next weekend. Let me get my bonus!! pllluueeessse God pluuueeesse!</p>

        <p>Started working in VC.NET. The Visual Studio 2005 BETA is out! really kewl stuff. I simply love the IDE enhancements<br />
I had to port an application from VC6 to VC.NET. It was such a breeze. a little googling and most of the issues are under control<br />
Will post an article on it sometime</p>

<p>I also got myself, the GoF Design Patterns book! simply amazing and such a great read, I must say</p>

        <span class="post-date">Fri, May 27, 2005</span>
        <p>I simply love that plugin - Batch categories, like a myriad of other wordpress users. (A thousand thanks to Stephanie Booth wouldn&rsquo;t suffice ;) ), but I had problems getting it to work in 1.5.1</p>

<p>Lots of results out there, that explain how to fix it, but none that lets a newbie get it up quickly. I know this is a repetition, but it still took my more than a day to get it fixed (mebbe it&rsquo;s my dull head.. but then again)</p>

<p>If you are brand new to Word press, here it. As simple as it gets (or atleast I think so&hellip; do get back in case you have doubts)</p>

<p>1. Download and install Batch-categories (0.9) from <a href="http://climbtothestars.org/archives/2004/07/13/batch-categories-09/">here</a>.<br />
2. Installing implies, that you copy the batch-categories.php file to /wp-admin/<br />
3. Edit /wp-admin/batch-categories.php and do the modifications as detailed below</p>

<p>**Change this:<br />
**</p>

<p>$title = __(&lsquo;Batch Categories&rsquo;);<br />
$parent_file = &lsquo;edit.php&rsquo;;<br />
require_once(&lsquo;admin-header.php&rsquo;);</p>

<p><strong>to this:</strong></p>

<p>$title = __(&lsquo;Batch Categories&rsquo;);<br />
$parent_file = &lsquo;edit.php&rsquo;;<br />
**require_once(&lsquo;admin.php&rsquo;);<br />
**require_once(&lsquo;admin-header.php&rsquo;);</p>

<p>Save batch-categories.php. Now launching it in your browser directly, will give you the required functionality (batch editing categories ie )</p>

<p>4. If you want to include it as part of your admin screen, then open ****/wp-admin/menu.php</p>

<p>**Below this:<br />
**</p>

<p>$submenu[&lsquo;edit.php&rsquo;][30] = array(__(&lsquo;Files&rsquo;), 8, &lsquo;templates.php&rsquo;);</p>

<p>**Add this:<br />
**</p>

<p>$submenu[&lsquo;edit.php&rsquo;][40] = array(__(&lsquo;Batch Categories&rsquo;), 1, &lsquo;batch-categories.php&rsquo;);</p>

<p>**5. Edit /wp-admin/batch-categories.php and delete the following:<br />
**</p>

<p>&lt; ul id=&ldquo;adminmenu2?&gt;<br />
&lt; li&gt;&lt; a href=&ldquo;edit.php&rdquo;&gt;&lt; /a&gt;&lt; /li&gt;<br />
&lt; li&gt;&lt; a href=&ldquo;edit-comments.php&rdquo;&gt;&lt; ?php _e(&lsquo;Comments&rsquo;) ?&gt;&lt; /a&gt;&lt; /li&gt;<br />
&lt; li&gt;&lt; a href=&ldquo;moderation.php&rdquo;&gt;&lt; ?php _e(&lsquo;Awaiting Moderation&rsquo;) ?&gt;&lt; /a&gt;&lt; /li&gt;<br />
&lt; li class=&ldquo;last&rdquo;&gt;&lt; a href=&ldquo;batch-categories.php&rdquo; class=&ldquo;current&rdquo;&gt;&lt; ?php _e(&lsquo;Batch Categories&rsquo;) ?&gt;&lt; /a&gt;&lt; /li&gt;<br />
&lt; /ul&gt;</p>

<p>Well, I always beleive that if you want to learn, then you need to do things the hardest way possible. Then, the next time around you can eliminate that way and go on to more efficient ways. On that note, if you don&rsquo;t want to do all the editing yourself. You can find the files here. Just download them and put them in you wp-admin directory, and enjoy! Ofcourse, you better take all the backups required and don&rsquo;t spam me if something is screwed up in your database.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://shvelmur.com/uploads/batch-categories.php.txt">batch-categories.php</a></li>
<li><a href="http://shvelmur.com/uploads/menu.php.txt">menu.php</a></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Note: 1. Do not use left-click on the above link. Use right-click and &ldquo;Save Link As..&rdquo;/&ldquo;Save Target As..&rdquo; and rename the file to *.php instead of *.php.txt<br />
2. The above files are valid for 1.5.1 Wordpress only. Please follow the manual procedure for later versions</em></p>

<p><strong>Wishlist for batch categories(BC)</strong><br />
Since we are discussing BC here, I thought I&rsquo;ll jot down a couple things that would make BC really kewl</p>

<ul>
<li>Display categories already assigned</li>
<li>Instead of a combo, use a multiple listbox</li>
<li>report category names instead of IDs</li>
<li>UI for options like number of posts,etc</li>
<li>Paging - displays all posts, but on different pages.</li>
</ul>

<p>Maybe I should get in touch with steph about this, but then before that I need start exploring php (I&rsquo;m a total novice on that)</p>

        <span class="post-date">Thu, May 26, 2005</span>
        <p>Hip hip hurrah! (applause ..) I finally managed to get my site up using <a href="http://wordpress.org/">wordpress</a>. A truly wondeful peice of software. Thanks to all those developers and plugin-authors for their wonderful contribution to the world of blogging! I know that blogs are becoming less fashionable, but I have always been more into what is functional than fashionable.. It server my needs and that&rsquo;s all I care about. I&rsquo;m trying to make it look more static, like a normal website, but that is beside the point.</p>

<p>Anyway, I still need to get the main page going, and also transfer my photos, to this interface. I also, am not very content with the way photo organisation is handled by most of the plugins.. Looks like the start of learning another scripting language. I&rsquo;m kinda occupied now, with the preparation for my CCNP switching exam.. but let us see how it goes. Meanwhile, I need to learn to blog a lot more!</p>

<p>btw, just in case I forget, I need to setup up a new section for the what&rsquo;s happening in my life right now (books being read, etc), also a section for orkut , yahoo, etc profiles and integrate orkut into my site. (Another plugin? ) today must be some kind of a light blub day!! ;)</p>

        <p>Roaches have attacked the toner in laser printers .. or so some judges claim! however the infrastructure team claim that they have found yet another effective way of dealing with them.. the heat and the laser killing the roaches!?</p>

<p>Now how weird is that. Check it out <a href="http://www.metamorphosis.org.mk/eng_vesti_detal.asp?id=386">here</a></p>
