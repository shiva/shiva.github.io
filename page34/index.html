    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2007/06/one-cat-and-lots-of-code">One cat and lots of code</a></h1>

    <div id="post">
      <p><a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3084/2567730043_da7faab448_m.jpg"><img style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 15px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;" src="/images/2707311301_b6f984beba_m.jpg" border="0" alt="12052007282" width="160" height="240" align="left" /></a>Rich Skrenta elucidates the <a href="http://www.skrenta.com/2007/05/code_is_our_enemy.html">power of less code</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>I ask you, grasshopper, which is better: flexible code or tiny code?<br />
"Ah," you exclaim, "Learned master, it is a trick question: code which is tiny yet flexible is best!"<br />
WRONG! Tiny code is always best. Now you must carry water up the hill for the rest of the day.</p></blockquote>
<p>For sure, he can't think up of good stories. Just Kidding! Every time we, developers, make a change or fix a bug, we decide the fate of that particular code flow. We take a call on how the module or component is going to behave for the rest of the life of that application.</p>
<p>While I agree that writing reams of code for something expressed much more simply, is evil, is it really the amount of code that you put in a file/class/function that influences the manageability of code. I personally am convinced that number of conditional branching clauses (more simply put if..then..else) that you use is evil(er). The lesser if..then clauses you have in your code, the lesser bugs you will produce.</p>
<p>He then, goes on about something that is totally a different beast. Abstraction in the name of flexibility:</p>
<blockquote><p>When most people learn objective languages, the first thing they do is go ape. I mean, they create superclasses that have one method, which is stubbed out, and twenty children classes, each of which varies by one line of code. They fall so in love with objects that they think everything needs to be its OWN TYPE of object.<br />
Often this is done in the name of flexibility. "Look, I have this abstract superclass which currently does the drawing for all my buttons, but you could subclass it to, say, draw 3D text!"</p></blockquote>
<p>This is something, that I just couldn't believe is a real problem. Why? Well, I have, in my last 6+ years of development in both, service and product companies, never ever had to stay awake because of too much abstraction.</p>
<p>Most of the time, I find the converse is true. Apparently anyone (who write code for money: (Ohh.. by the way, the word apparently is a very convenient word, it lets me state something, without having to really prove it with some hard facts :) - I learned this from <a href="http://www.douglasadams.com/">Douglas - we miss ye</a>)), seems uninterested in abstracting code, care less for code re-use.</p>
<p>Let us just step back and think, why do most people want to be <strong>this evil! </strong>Human tendency is to achieve a goal, with the least amount of effort possible. (I can bet my head on this: Say we find someway to automate the ability to ingest food, and excrete it, most will gladly adopt it! )</p>
<p>Well, it is always much easier to write a function yourself, to achieve that day's goal to fix X number of bugs or getting a feature Y done and commit the code, than to go hunting for abstractions and re-factor <strong>already tested</strong> code.</p>
<p>Trust me, Rich, I have <strong>never ever </strong>found an unwanted abstraction, or even class hierarchies that run more than a few classes deep. Do I wish, what you were stating is true in the industry? I most truly will be the happiest application programmer, if my library developers actually remembered that they develop libraries, and if my colleagues remembered that someday, they will have to fix bugs in their own code, because of the million functional flows they created and the lack of any code reuse that they have ensured.</p>
<p>However, one thing that I really subscribe to is:</p>
<blockquote><p>Don't make your code more flexible until after you have a plan for what your app.</p></blockquote>
<p>I would like to add one more clause of wisdom to that:</p>
<p>"Re-factor you code, at every single opportunity you get, even if it means that you need to bite your manager's head off!"</p>
<p>If you did read upto here, then I must say : boy you need to get a life!! (Sorry, couldn't resist that). Thanks anyway, and if you are still wondering, why I put a kitten's picture up there and what it has to do with developing code - well - Nothing! No really - Nothing at all!! I read somewhere that putting pictures was an important part of writing a blog - something to do with eye-tracking and better design and all the other things that I don't really care about. Ok, I now need to shut up - not another word!</p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2007/05/computing-webified-a-bit-too-much">Computing webified a bit too much</a></h1>

    <div id="post">
      <p>Over the last couple of years, the onslaught of web 2.0 apps has almost made the desktop irrelevant. With a service offering for almost every kind of application that a normal user would use, the age of installing applications is near its fag-end.</p>
<p>Is this good? Is this the direction we want to head towards? More importantly, does it make real sense for end-users? Ok let's see what you pay for a normal laptop these days.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dell.com/content/products/features.aspx/cto_inspn_e1505?c=us&amp;cs=19&amp;l=en&amp;s=dhs">Dell Inspiron E1505 Notebooks</a></p>
<p>If you get the above mentioned laptop, you pay around $1000 for the OS (Vista), a bunch of useless programs that you will never use, 1 GB of RAM and tons of HDD space. Now, let's see what are the other&nbsp;costs of using online apps. (assuming that you use only open-source/free applications like I do, that would be the cost of using desktop apps)</p>
<ol>
<li>Pay for broadband services </li>
<li>Cost of working online.</li>
</ol>
<p>The second part is something that we never measure. Let us say, you want to write a really lenthy document, say, you are student and want to do your assginment using an online writer (like <a href="http://www.zoho.com/">Zoho</a> or <a href="http://docs.google.com/">Google Docs</a>). How long does it take for you to get your work done vs the time is takes whilst using Open Office ro MS Word. The whole process of getting on the web, signing into your application of choice, clicking on a zillion things, your document loading along with a few MBs (I'm exaggerating, a few hundred KBs if not more) worth of javascript, on your browser that leaks memory like a sieve.</p>
<p>Over time, you see that you end up losing quite a bit of time, not to mention energy, waiting for web-apps to load up and for you to get your work done. Well, one thing is easy with web-apps and that is collaboration. You want to share your documents with a couple of friends, or maybe be your class, then it usually takes just a click, and you can share it with the world if you please and get it indexed on a search engine in a shorter time. That has been the key advantage, more than the claimed, ease of use, simplicity and the lack of install. Another thing that is very attractive is versioning capabilities that most tools have today.</p>
<p>Check out this article on <a href="http://webworkerdaily.com/2007/05/23/open-thread-do-rich-internet-applications-matter-to-you/">how much RIA matters to the common man</a></p>
<p>Also, check out this comparison of <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/webified_desktop_apps_vs_browser_apps.php">Webified-Desktop Apps Vs Browser-based Apps</a></p>
<p>Personally, as an end-user, I could care less if I am oblivious to the context of an application, whether online or offline. I need to be able to </p>
<ul>
<li>Get access to my data, whether I am online or not. </li>
<li>Open and work with my data instantaneously (ofcourse, this is currently not available with either online or&nbsp;desktop apps)</li>
<li>Share the content that I have created with my colleagues</li>
<li>Keep a log of changes that will make it easier for me to get my content back in case I screw up</li>
</ul>
<p>When all of that happens, whether on the desktop or from within a browser, I would be one content user, and computers would have done what they were supposed to do in the first place. DO MY WORK FOR ME, so that I can GO BE CREATIVE!</p>

    <div id="post">
      <p>Finally upgraded to <a href="http://wordpress.org/download/">wordpress 2.2.</a></p>
<p>Geez!! It was released almost a week back and I hadn't upgraded!!! I know, I know! I am a little paranoid!</p>
<p>I wonder why, that every time I update my wordpress version, I need to go through this very laborious task, of backing up my database, the entire wordpress folder, the last underwear that I wore, etc. Scripts guys! I need a script that does all that. Installing wordpress takes 2 steps, but upgrading 5?!</p>
<p>Your concise 5 step upgrade, cost me almost an hour (check and recheck everything)</p>
<p>I understand that you need to change a lot of things in a release, but atleast, you can stop fiddling with the database schema, for every single release?! Or maybe, you don't! I have no way of knowing. Do let me know, if I really require to backup, when you make a release.</p>
<p>If I do, give me a script that I can run, a UI would be nice, that would tar/zip the directories, replace all files that require replacing. You know what? I would really like it if I can run a cron job, that will contact the wordpress website, download the latest patch and upgrade my blog, all when I am doing my laundry (Then I can forget about my blog, and wash my underwear!)</p>
<p>I am willing to write a plugin for this if someone can work with me! Anyone?</p>
<p>(Update: I'm <strike>moving to</strike> (trying out) Technocrati tags. Let's see how these work!)</p>

      <p>And the timing is perfect. Mr Dell, as it turns out (a little Douglassy, eh? Don't get it, read "Salmon of Doubt", the last book by Douglas Adams, pg 27), runs Ubuntu, Feisty Fawn on his <a href="http://www.dell.com/content/topics/global.aspx/corp/biographies/en/msd_computers">home PC</a>. Well, one of his PCs, he has four mamoths with 4GB RAM and a Quadro FX 3500 et al, costing well over $4000. Aparently, he also runs windows as well. Hmmm... living the high life.</p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2007/04/how-to-brew-tea-earl-grey-the-english-way">How to brew tea (Earl Grey) - The English Way</a></h1>

    <div id="post">
      <p>I've been on a reading binge lately. With quite a few hours of flying time, and long waits at airport lounges, I got the chance to catch up on my reading. Went through two books this time around, the placid, but mildly interesting <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Namesake-Novel-Jhumpa-Lahiri/dp/0395927218">"The Namesake" by Jhumpa Lahiri</a> (skip the book and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0433416/">watch the movie</a>.. way better) and the exhilariting final masterpiece, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Salmon-Doubt-Hitchhiking-Galaxy-Last/dp/1400045088">"The Salmon of Doubt",</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Salmon_of_Doubt">wikipedia entry here</a>) by the new age, space comic, <a href="http://www.douglasadams.com/">Douglas</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Adams">Adams</a>.</p>
<p>The Salmon, is a collection of various bits of Douglas' writing, and it reveals the quirky, and funny guy that he was. I couldn't resist putting this anecdote online (although it might be breaching some copyright - so please don't copy it any further and if someone wants to take this down, just drop me a comment)</p>
<p><strong>How to brew Tea - Douglas Adams</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Go to Marks and Spencer and by a packet of Earl Grey tea.</li>
<li>Go back to where you are staying and boil a kettle of water.</li>
<li>While it is coming to boil, open the sealed packet and sniff.</li>
<li>Careful - you may feel a bit dizzy, but this is in fact perfectly legal.</li>
<li>When the kettle has boiled, pour a little of it into a teapot, swirl it around , and tip it out again.</li>
<li>Put a couple (or three, depending on the size of the pot) of tea bags into the pot. (If I was really trying to lead you into the paths of righteousness, I would tell you to use free leaves rather than bags, but let's take this in easy stages.)</li>
<li>Bring the kettle back upto a boil, and then pour the boiling water as quickly as you can into the pot.</li>
<li>Let it stand for two or three minutes, and then pour it into a cup.</li>
</ol>
<p>He continues, "Some will tell you that you shouldn't have milk with Earl Grey, just a slice of lemon. Screw them. I like it with milk."</p>
<p>now, there it is. That's how you make a wonderful pot of tea for yourself. Earl Grey at that - the English Way. And, what do you know, he likes it with milk, just like I do! Now, go make yourself a pot of tea and sip at it!!</p>
