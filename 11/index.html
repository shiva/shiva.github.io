        <span class="post-date">Tue, Jan 30, 2007</span>
        <p>Been using Windows Live Writer as my blog writing tool. Here are some plugins that I would definetly make my life much easier. If you are insterested in writing a plugin or would like to add to these requirements, do get in touch.</p>

<li>Recent Links</li>
<li>Links from clipboard</li>
<li>Auto-link insertion based on certain keywords</li>

</ul></li>

        <span class="post-date">Fri, Jan 26, 2007</span>
        <p>After a whole month, of wearing a cast, I got my hand back today. This is the first time, in 30 days that I am using both my hands to type and it feels good to be back (atleast partially).</p>

<p>Here are some pics of my hand.</p>

<p><a href="http://shvelmur.com/images/wpress/2d1d646124a3_FB22/DSC005915.jpg"><img src="http://blog.shiv.me/images/DSC00591_thumb2.jpg" alt="" /></a> That is the result of a 4 cm incision on my elbow, to re-align a 3 cm X 2 cm piece of cartiledge that had broken and had torn into my tricep. The doc says, that upto 10 cms of the tricep was torn by this piece. They have affixed this piece to my elbow with a screw to keep it in place.</p>

<p>I have to undergo a minimum of 5 days of physio therapy. I went for my first session today, and by far the worst part of breaking a bone, is doing physio! God it is painful to stretch your hand, after not moving it for a month. It is also very liberating that we get the faculty of using both hands!</p>

<p>I can imagine the struggle that those who are unfortunate to lose a limb, go through, to get through daily activities. I must thank my stars and all those who took great care of me.</p>

<p>Once again, at the risk of sounding very soapy, I thank all of you who kept me going.<br />
Here are some more pictures.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Thu, Jan 25, 2007</span>
        <p>Trying to get the Sony Ericsson W800i has been by far the most traumatic experience of my life. I tried everything possible, but still was unable to get it recognised on my home PC!</p>

<p>So, finally I decided to resort to the most reliable way to get anything to work with a PC. Do a google search!!!</p>

<p>Found a wonderful link, (on a forum that solved the issue). Here is the fix suggested, (I have organised in to be more of a step-by-step guide.</p>

<p>The following involves tampering with the Windows Registry. Kindly take a BACKUP of your registry using regedit before attempting any changes. Oh yeah.. you are on your own in case you screw up something.</p>

<p>EXPORT ALL THE KEYS MENTIONED BELOW BEFORE DELETING THEM! ALWAYS BEST TO HAVE A BACKUP</p>

<ul>
<li>Make sure your phone is NOT connected to your computer.</li>
<li>Run Regedit.</li>
<li>Browse to &ldquo;My ComputerHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESYSTEMCurrentControlSetEnumUSB&rdquo;</li>
<li>Delete all key that start with &ldquo;Vis_0fce&amp;Pid_d028&rdquo;.</li>
<li>You should be back to a stage where no w800 is installed on your machine.</li>
<li>Download the drivers (Approved ones) from SE&rsquo;s website under Support.</li>
<li>Run the EXE file and let it install.</li>
<li>Connect your phone through the USB cable.</li>
</ul>

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Jan 20, 2007</span>
        <p>With advent of web 2.0, and some habits cultivated over the last decade, I have a certain list of tasks that I do everyday. I current visit a bunch of websites more than once a day, and an integrated interface would do me so much good.</p>

<ul>
<li>mail, a whole set of accounts, gmail, yahoo, etc<br /></li>
<li>feed readers<br /></li>
<li>blog editor<br /></li>
<li>orkut<br /></li>
<li>del.icio<br /></li>
<li>google notebook</li>
</ul>

<p>What is lacking, is the ability to have a single sign-on/account mgmt capability, a common dashboard, ability to cross-launch/cross-post content.</p>

<p>Ohh yeah, I want to do thiss all from either my desktop or from my own hosted page.</p>

<p>So there are some deep implicating requirements for my latest craze - get more done with less clicks!</p>

<p>I christen it Common Access Portal (Let&rsquo;s put a CAP on things we use!)</p>

        <span class="post-date">Tue, Jan 16, 2007</span>
        <p>On the 2nd of Jan, I fell off my bike and fractured my elbow. Been out of action since then. Thanks for all you guys, who kept me company.</p>

<p>Special thanks to Guru, Tanigai, Rajsekar, Shankar (my bro), Swetha (my sis). My mom, granny and dad, for nurrsing me back to health and for putting up with me (I know how much of a pain in the ***, I can be!)</p>

        <span class="post-date">Tue, Jan 16, 2007</span>
        <p>The following is something I wrote 14th Dec 2005, on my trial account with one of the earliest Web 2.0 spplication services, called <a href="http://backpackit.com">backpackit.com</a></p>

<p>The site still continues to be a hot seller, with over 200,000 subscriptions. You can find the link to the original article <a href="http://123.writeboard.com/507c45ee96e470fe2">here</a>.</p>

<p>I post the whole content here, well coz I like my content in my own space! Now there is a feature that no web 2.0 application allows. Why can&rsquo;t content reside separate from the service? Every application from gmail to backpackit, want you to trust them with your content. I think that should change, mebbe we shoul called that web 2.5?</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>What can people do with the web?</em></p>

<p><em>Why did this ubiquous concept of sharing information for free (and paid) catch so rapidly, that is is now considered the next greatest thing since sliced bread? What makes it so very exciting for millions across the world to share the small section of expertise that they possess with the rest of the world?</em></p>

<p><em>I have had the good fortune, to have been exposed to the web in its very early days (1994-1995). Back then, if you had the chance to browse a website, you were considered super-cool and you would be the talk of the school (yup, I was in high school at that time) for a whole month! You finally were considered a super-geek, who KNEW the NET! Pretty interesting when you consider that these days you have scores of 6th grade kids that scream, HTML and Javascript in their sleeps (I actually happen to know at least 2 13 year olds who do that!).<br />
Humble beginings</em></p>

<p><em>We would use this hyper-cool browser called Lynx. You will have to manually establish a ppp connection to your local ISPs gateway (whose root password was usually set to root or root123 or thereabouts) using hyperterminal and then you would need use unix programs to access your mail, browse the net and that was about all you could do (once you discovered root access it was a different ball-game altogether though â€&rdquo; think VPNsâ€¦ meaning to say we ran our own ISPs! ). Security was of no concern since most of the hardware failed to provide connectivity forget security. Anyway a modem would cost around Rs 4000 (I usually got Rs 50 a month as pocket money â€&rdquo; I would save 50% of that ) so no one was really connecting in and exploiting the gateway!</em></p>

<p><em>What made the web exciting then, was the ability to check out, what was there on some machine somewhere â€&rdquo; the ability to access information from sources (mostly universities) that were located far beyond the realm of a 15 year old kidâ€&trade;s imagination. The excitement of finding a small exploit or a getting access to some cutting edge research material was enough to keep us making endless tries to get a stable connection and our eyes glued to our text-based browsers.<br />
Web 1.0</em></p>

<p><em>Then, it was the rise of Netscape that redefined the NET as we knew it. Suddenly we could see images, we could hear music (mostly MIDI - that idea never struck on much), we could chat with people across the globe, could make friends from the farthest reaches of the human race. At one point of time, I had close to 200 people on my chat list on Yahoo Messenger, from London to Vladivastock, from Sydney to â€œsome cityâ€ in Greenland.</em></p>

<p><em>The age of Netscape brought the entire human race closer together, people from different countries could interact without the physical presence. The concept of community thinking and collective thought gave the web an entirely new meaning. It slowly brought about the change in the way we work, we kept in touch with relatives in distant lands, it replaced the postal service for most uses, it brought down the call charges as VOIP slowly crept it. Such point of inflection usually generate a flurry of activity in the development community, which invariably leads to innovation and new technologies coming to production.<br />
Web 2.0</em></p>

<p><em>Today, we are at such an inflection point. What is different this time around is that this change in the way of the web, is caused by huge commercial demand placed on the set of 10-year-old Web 1.0 technologies. The internet has entered our lives and entwined itself in such in-seperable ways into the fabric of human interaction that the users of the NET are now demanding more and more from the NET. It has moved from being a medium to keep a bunch of college professors in sync with each other, to a mammoth â€œwebâ€ that spans the globe and touches our lives in every which way possible.</em></p>

<p><em>So what are we talking about here? We talking shared computing. There will be a day, not very much in the future, when we will hire processing power, we will hire application services for those needs that we buy a computer and pay loads of licensing cost in the form of software fees.</em></p>

<p><em>Web 2.0 will place more importance of generation of content, distributing it to the destination, without having the need to spend too much effort on the user (No buying this software or that, maybe even, no buying any hardware at all). It is about collaborative working. Any task, can now be worked upon by any number of people, in any number of geographies. We are going beyond the realms of our physical-selves.</em></p>

<p><em>The past one year has seen the revival and slow maturation of a 10 year old technology that was part of HTTP 1.0. By now, if you have been doing any form of web programming you would have heard about AJAX and AHAH. Although the names given to these concept of web-programming are relatively new, the technology that is used here have been available since Web1.0 days.</em></p>

<p><em>So what is the novelty? What is the â€œnewâ€ thing?</em></p>

<p><em>The novelty is that the NET as we know it is ready for change, ready to take the next step in getting the human race closer, helping it communicate and collaborate better. A lot of tools have already emerged in the real world. Applications that are currently free services, but offer extremely interesting opportunities for revenue generation. The service that I am using to write this article for instance is a Web 2.0 based online document editor. Check out more such tools below</em></p>

<li><em><a href="http://BackPackIt.com">BackPackIt</a></em></li>
</ul>

<p><em>In summary, the last 2 to 3 years has taken the web from a static collection of web pages, to a dynamic data processing environment, to which human life is irrevocably intertwined, bring itself closer. Human interaction has left the physical limits of our bodies and expression of thought has taken a whole new meaning. So the question we should ask ourselves now should be</em></p>

        <span class="post-date">Mon, Jan 15, 2007</span>
        <p>Having broken my elbow, I have spent the last two weeks typing away with a single hand. With nothing much to do, I went about looking at ways to improve the capabilities of blog editors. I use BlogDesk for my blogging needs. It is a wonderful editor, that let you do all operations provided by MetaWeblog API. However I wanted to do more than what was provided there. I wanted to add some features for plugins that I used.</p>

<p>The following is a propopsed list of extensions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create/edit posts<br /></li>
<li>define post passwords (<em>Thanks to <a href="http://www.blogdesk.org/en/index.htm">Johannes Oppermann</a>, developer of the wonderful blog client, BlogDesk</em><a href="http://www.blogdesk.org/en/index.htm">)</a><br /></li>
<li>image insert from different services (flickr)<br /></li>
<li>tagging support<br /></li>
<li>Similar to <a href="http://redalt.com/wiki/Comment+Quicktags">QuickTags</a> plugin<br /></li>
<li>Support for <a href="http://www.neato.co.nz/ultimate-tag-warrior/">Ultimate Tag Warrior&rsquo;s </a> features<br /></li>
<li>Adsense integration</li>
<li>
Admin Support<br /></li>
<li>display a dasboard<br /></li>
<li>Spam Karma comment moderation<br /></li>
<li>Adsense data</li>
</ul>

<p>In my search I found some interesting links.<br />

        <span class="post-date">Fri, Dec 29, 2006</span>
        <p>Though many disagree, and think of software development as a mundane, non-creative task, as Kevin Carlson@DDJ puts it aptly, it is a work of art!</p>

<p><em><a href="http://www.ddj.com/debugblog/archives/2006/12/the_static_idea.html">&ldquo;I suppose the question is this: &ldquo;where are the limits of the scientific approach in software development?&rdquo; I mean, we are, ultimately, talking about an act of creation&rdquo;</a> -</em> Kevin Carlson</p>

<p>(note the nested quotes! ;) )</p>

<p>Many of my non-IT friends have asked, how I keep myself interested and how I stand to sit (pun intended) in front of the PC for such long hours and not get burned out?! The reason for this question is partly, I guess, because not every developer that writes software, thinks of it as an art form, and hence most software automate mundane tasks .. users often do very boring stuff with computers .. stuff like filling forms, writing email etc.</p>

<p>For me, development has always been a joy. The sheer magic of creating something out of a void! Seeing an application morph from a bunch of requirements into a working product, and addressing the needs of a set of users (the users feeling their needs are addressed) is perhaps one of the greatest feeling one can experience.</p>

<p>It has been my good fortune to have done (atleast a little) good work in the last half-decade. Hope many more of such half-decades are yet to come.</p>

<p>Oh yeah! Managers, please stop trying to over optimize your estimation techniques, remember: An artist needs space; A team of artists, need space, time and money!</p>

        <h1 class="post-title"><a href="http://blog.shiv.me/2006/12/26/windows-live-writer---growing-pains/">Windows Live writer - Growing pains</a></h1>
        <span class="post-date">Tue, Dec 26, 2006</span>
        <p>I just downloaded Windows Live Writer</p>

<p>At first look, it looks good! I haven&rsquo;t been able to say that about most Microsoft products off late. The last product that was awe-inspiring was perhaps VC++ 6.0 (such wide range of features), IE 6.0 (it was big deal when it came into the market) and maybe, to some extent Office 2003 (a lot less buggy and smaller file sizes than previous releases).</p>

<p>It is perhaps one of the few blog editors that provide an intuitive interface for adding links and particularly images. This is feature alone is reason enough to use this editor. (That is how painful, other editors tend to be).</p>

<p>I have a personal blog, using wordpress as my blog-engine, and would like to store pictures on my own server, that uploading them to some service that decides when to throw my stuff away! Live writer a is pleasure to use in this department. Just select your image, using the all too familiar File Open Common Control, and insert it in your post.</p>

<p><a href="http://shvelmur.com/images/wpress/WindowsLivewriterGrowingpains_A23C/bunty4.jpg"><img src="http://blog.shiv.me/images/bunty_thumb2.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Inserting the above image, took just a coupla seconds (finally, I can do something useful using a M$ product, and I can do it very quickly too - Note to developers of M$ products - sorry about being soo sarcastic, but that is how exasperated I am using products that are way too generic. What we need these days are very focused and compact solutions, that don&rsquo;t attempt to solve a zillion use-cases using a single product)</p>

<p>Some of the kewl stuf that can be done with Live writer and I&rsquo;m talking just image manipulations! (Stop it with images!! &hellip; Can&rsquo;t control it &hellip;.. Need to write about other features too!!)</p>

<strong>mac</strong>: $home/mac/en-US/Firefox 2.0.0.1.dmg</p>

<p>There are some issues upon upgrading. Some plugins have trouble working, notably Google Accelerator. You might want to disable that for a while and wait around for an upgrade.</p>

<p>Also, the upgrade sometimes causes an infinite loop, when upgrading from Firefox 2.0 using the built-in auto-updater. Firefox restarts and starts to download the upgrade, and throws an error about lack of file permissions, the updater terminates and starts again. The only way to get out of that loop is to either log off from windows or terminate your network connection (don&rsquo;t try this at your workplace :) ).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m yet to confirm it as a bug, but just in case you are also facing the same, do let me know. For 2.0.0.1 upgrade, please use the download links to download the Firefox installer and upgrade offline. This I have found to be the safest route for now!</p>

        <span class="post-date">Sun, Dec 24, 2006</span>
        <p>Having joined Novell recently, the opportunity to learn a bunch of new development skills has come up. Novell products make extensive use of the mono platform for applications development.</p>

<p>After 4 long years, I find myself in need of re-learning some windows application development. I tried setting up mono on my windows pc, and encountered some peculiar issues. I had installed mono and then went looking around for an IDE. Well, monodevelop sounded kewl, and tried to get in compiled on windows. I found that I needed to setup cygwin if I need to build it, and another 100 MB download is not what I wanted to be doing.</p>

<p>So I pulled Sharpdevelop 2.1.0, (monodevelop was apparently forked from sharpdevelop), off <a href="http://www.icsharpcode.net/OpenSource/SD/Download/">here</a>, and I installed it. As per the instructions found <a href="http://community.sharpdevelop.net/blogs/mattward/archive/2005/10/12/SharpDevelopAndMono.aspx">here</a>, I tried to compile the application, but SharpDevelop, threw a twister at me. It said &ldquo;mono is not installed&rdquo;. I tried hunting around for some options somewhere that told SharpDevelop where to look for mono, but was able to find no help.</p>

<p>Well, I did get it fixed. All I had to do was re-run mono install.</p>

<p>Aparently, the order of installation of the IDE and mono is:</p>

<p>1. Install the IDE<br />
2. Install mono</p>

<p>I always thought that it had to be the other way around. Nice curve ball that one!<br />
Anyway, here&rsquo;s the very first application that I have written in C# running on Mono!</p>

        <p>&hellip; that, my friends, in Italian means &ldquo;Good bye! We have arrived!!&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I have recently movd from my 4 year old job at HCL Technologies, Chennai to Novell, Bangalore. The first day at Novell was nice. The experience exuded professionallism on the part of the company and the people that I am going to work with.</p>

<p>Life seems exciting. On the very first day, I have a machine, access to email, food coupons, bank account, an airtel connection, travel info and more than I can remember. Amazing how quick things can be done these days! ;)<br />
Finally, I did feel the loss I should have felt when I left HCL, my colleagues for the last four years! This quantum change, I hope will bring more challenges and exciting engineering problems for me to work. (God I sound cliched!)</p>

<p>I have a lot of documentation to read in the next coupla days! So off I go!</p>

        <p>As with <a href="http://discovery.nasa.gov/">Discovery</a>, after a lot of hurdles (some within me and some otherwise), here I am about to take-off on yet another journey, that, I hope is going to be as exciting as the last one that I took, when I joined <a href="http://newsroom.cisco.com/dlls/global/asiapac/news/2006/pr_02-27.html">HCL-Cisco ODC</a>. I has been an amazing experience in the last week or so, when I have been reminiscing about what I am about to do, what I have done, the wonderful people that I encountered and worked with, and the good and bad times.</p>

<p>Loads of work ahead! So I&rsquo;m hoping that I will get a day to myself. I got too many people that I need to say farewell to, in person!</p>

For those who don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;ve been working at HCL Technologies, Chennai, Cisco Offshore Development Centre, for the last 4+ years.</p>

<p>Reasons</p>

<p>1. my wife&rsquo;s moving there!<br />
2. My WIFE&rsquo;s MOVING do you need more!! ;)</p>

<p>I hope to start work with a company in Bangalore. So you guys in cool B&rsquo;lore, here I come!</p>

<p>I have another coupla weeks to go, so I might be absent from the blog for the upcoming weeks! Then again, I will try to blog my experience quitting a company! That&rsquo;s a nice sustainable idea!</p>
