      <p>Having joined Novell recently, the opportunity to learn a bunch of new development skills has come up. Novell products make extensive use of the mono platform for applications development.</p>

<p>After 4 long years, I find myself in need of re-learning some windows application development. I tried setting up mono on my windows pc, and encountered some peculiar issues. I had installed mono and then went looking around for an IDE. Well, monodevelop sounded kewl, and tried to get in compiled on windows. I found that I needed to setup cygwin if I need to build it, and another 100 MB download is not what I wanted to be doing.</p>

<p>So I pulled Sharpdevelop 2.1.0, (monodevelop was apparently forked from sharpdevelop), off <a href="http://www.icsharpcode.net/OpenSource/SD/Download/">here</a>, and I installed it. As per the instructions found <a href="http://community.sharpdevelop.net/blogs/mattward/archive/2005/10/12/SharpDevelopAndMono.aspx">here</a>, I tried to compile the application, but SharpDevelop, threw a twister at me. It said &ldquo;mono is not installed&rdquo;. I tried hunting around for some options somewhere that told SharpDevelop where to look for mono, but was able to find no help.</p>

<p>Well, I did get it fixed. All I had to do was re-run mono install.</p>

<p>Aparently, the order of installation of the IDE and mono is:</p>

<p>1. Install the IDE<br />
2. Install mono</p>

<p>I always thought that it had to be the other way around. Nice curve ball that one!<br />
Anyway, here&rsquo;s the very first application that I have written in C# running on Mono!</p>
