    <p>Nice sunny day, and a huge auditorium filled with half of Chennai&rsquo;s Java crowd&hellip; well mebbe not exactly have, but close 2500 java programmers attended this year&rsquo;s Sun Tech Days held at Chennai,India. This is my first time at a Sun conference.Well, it is not a JavaOne kinda event, where it is all techie, but atleast you do get to meet a few like minded, hard-core, think-OOAD-in-the-shower guys. There were some very kewl speakers. I especially enjoyed</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Real-Time Java&rdquo; by Peter Kessler</li>
<li>&ldquo;Performance Tuning of Javaâ„¢ SE Applications&rdquo; by Chuk-Munn Lee</li>
</ul>
<p>I loved every session by those guys, and was really impressed by the breadth and depth of their knowledge (kudos to you guys)</p>
<p>The free Solaris day was as interesting as the rest of the days. There was a lot of marketing talk, but that&rsquo;s what the coffee machine&rsquo;s always on for!</p>
<p>Anyway, learnt a bit, interacted with a lot of Java developers and oh yeah!! I won the Java Jacket!! (One size small, but hey, it is kewl!!)</p>
<p>Will post a picture of it soon</p>
