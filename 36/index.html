      <p>Nishabd is a re-make of the very famous russian movie, Lolitta. I know, that the flavour of the day is re-mixing movies, but I must confess.. what a re-make? Amazing movie! I was simply blown away by the pathos of the story, the power of Amitabh&rsquo;s eyes and the great performances of every single character.
Personally, I think, this is the best performance by Amitabh. yes.. even more than Black. He has truly scaled peaks that probably most actors in the world can ever see.</p>

      <p>I had a hell of a time connecting using sify &ldquo;narrow&quot;band connection. After umpteen calls to sify call center, I decided to send mails to the CEO,CTO and Communications Officer of Sifycorp, to let them know of the pathetic state of affairs, and horrible experience of being a sify broadband user. I have attached a snapshot of the mail that I sent to them.
Here is the content of the mail in totem.</p>

      <p>Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam, has been, by far, the best president that India has ever had (atleast in my humble opinion). More than that, he has been one of the greatest ambassador of India and its culture.
He is the most energetic motivated I have known in my life. He is about to complete his term at the office of the President, and the following is a petition to extend his term at the helm of the country.</p>

      <p>One of my good friends, James (who wants to remain anonymous), asked me how I lost weight. So for his benefit and hopefully to inspire others here it is.
  Learn to ride a pulsar 180 at low speeds
  Ride around town until you find a road with some engine oil on it.
  Apply brakes (disc brakes are the most prefered) as soon as you ride on the oil.</p>
