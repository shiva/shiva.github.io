    <p>Hip hip hurrah! (applause ..) I finally managed to get my site up using <a href="http://wordpress.org/">wordpress</a>. A truly wondeful peice of software. Thanks to all those developers and plugin-authors for their wonderful contribution to the world of blogging! I know that blogs are becoming less fashionable, but I have always been more into what is functional than fashionable.. It server my needs and that&rsquo;s all I care about. I&rsquo;m trying to make it look more static, like a normal website, but that is beside the point.</p>
<p>Anyway, I still need to get the main page going, and also transfer my photos, to this interface. I also, am not very content with the way photo organisation is handled by most of the plugins.. Looks like the start of learning another scripting language. I&rsquo;m kinda occupied now, with the preparation for my CCNP switching exam.. but let us see how it goes. Meanwhile, I need to learn to blog a lot more!</p>
<p>btw, just in case I forget, I need to setup up a new section for the what&rsquo;s happening in my life right now (books being read, etc), also a section for orkut , yahoo, etc profiles and integrate orkut into my site. (Another plugin? ) today must be some kind of a light blub day!! ;)</p>
