    <p>Today has been a very sad day. I bid farewell to Mr Subramaniam.</p>
<p>He was my grandfather&rsquo;s nephew and has been my a great inspiration to me in my life. One of the bravest and knowledgeable persons I have known. One who lived through life with conviction and was as clear at heart as they come.</p>
<p>He has always been there for my family at good and bad times.</p>
<p>A devout and practising Hindu, and a learned man in vedic chants, I have always envied him of having lived in my grandfather&rsquo;s company. I think, what I know about my grandpa, is what &ldquo;mani thatha&rdquo; (what I used to call him) has told me of. Having lived in the pre-independance era, he has offered many insights into the lives of my forefathers.</p>
<p>You shall be remembered and your words cherished forever in our hearts. I wish your soul to rest in peace. Adieu my dear &ldquo;mani thatha&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Could we see when and where we are to meet again, we would be more tender when we bid our friends goodbye.&quot;</em></p>
<p><strong>&ndash; Marie Louise De La Ramee, [Ouida]</strong></p>
