        <p>I can&rsquo;t claim to be someone is really into environment protection, and I&rsquo;m not crazy paranoid about the junk I produce, but I do care about me, my family, and the future of mankind (mostly in that order). I recycle as much as I can, I try to avoid plastic bags, I don&rsquo;t throw garbage on the streets (I&rsquo;m shaking my fist at you, Shivanand-in-India-who-doesn&rsquo;t-live-there-anymore) etc.</p>

<p>I own a Macbook, and I wouldn&rsquo;t say that I&rsquo;m a big fan of Apple &ldquo;the company&rdquo;. However, I really like their products. The latest version of the macbook &ndash; that I&rsquo;m not going to upgrade to &ndash; has given me reason to like it even more! Apple has made a huge stride, in making computer more environment friendly. Here&rsquo;s the laundry-list of things they have eliminated from the Macbook (you read it right, ELIMINATED)</p>

<ul>
<li>Arsenic</li>
<li>BFR (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brominated_flame_retardant">Brominated Flame Retardant</a>)</li>
<li>Mercury</li>
<li>PVC</li>
</ul>

<p>The packaging is smaller by30-40% (on what was already a very small package). Ohhh.. I fail to mention the unibody Aluminium construction, which is not only durable, but also, completely recyclable!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, but the Apples cost so much more than the average-Joe PC! Why should I pay for eliminating stuff I don&rsquo;t care about?&rdquo;, you ask.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh well, let me tell you something&rdquo;, person-that-I-just-made-up-and-bashed-your-face-in-for-asking-such-a-stupid-question (That&rsquo;s from <a href="http://wilwheaton.typepad.com/wwdnbackup/2009/03/operation-crazy-idea-presents-the-criminal-minds-production-diary-the-audio-version.html">reading Wil Wheaton</a>, btw).</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is what happens to your average-Joe PC, once you are done with it in 6-months&rdquo;.</p>

<p>It gets dumped in third-world developing countries. Well, it is technically called &ldquo;exporting used goods&rdquo;. Used goods aren&rsquo;t much use when they don&rsquo;t work, are they? Of course, as it happens the people who are dealing with scrap, do so, because they have to find a way to eat the next day.</p>

<p>Anyway, I digress. Back to Apple now.</p>

<p>I think it is super that they have decided to invest engineering effort in make the products we use more environment friendly. Ofcourse, this doesn&rsquo;t mean that you need to run out and get that spanking new Macbook that you don&rsquo;t need. However, the next time you decide to buy a computer, think about this video, and see if you can wait a little longer to save up a little more to be able to buy the Macbook.</p>

<p>You can find more details about the environment friendliness of the macs at the following links</p>

        <p>I&rsquo;m a bit of a stickler, when it comes to audio recording. I hate using the mics that come with laptops or the standard desktop mic. Recently, a co-worker asked me about my setup (I record a piano, strictly for my listening pleasure, and NO, MIDI doesn&rsquo;t count).</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t find the links for my version of the mic, but here are some equivalents.</p>

<p><strong>USB Mics</strong></p>

<a href="http://www.samedaymusic.com/mc--2677101/product--MXLUSB007">MXL .007 USB Mic</a></p>

<p><strong>Mixers</strong></p>

<a href="http://www.samedaymusic.com/mc--2677101/product--BEHXENYX1202">Berhinger 1202</a></p>

<p>Once you start using a condenser mic, and hear the richness of the output, you&rsquo;ll never want to go back to the crappy on-board mics.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Feb 14, 2009</span>
        <p>Recently I got asked, what the best way to do a join between two large lists,  into another list was? I always tend to answer that question with: it depends.</p>

<p>Just like any other algorithm, there is no silver bullet. It is a trade off  between CPU and memory utilisation. Sometimes, we do have to think about these  things (this is code in c++ on a device with scarce resources, to say the  least).</p>

<p>Of course, the simplest solution for this would be to use multiple for loops:</p>

<p><code>**// merge - version 1**  
function List&lt;C&gt; merge(List&lt;A&gt; l1, List&lt;B&gt; l2) {</code></p>

<p></p>

<p><code>  // oh god! I shouldn't be doing this  
  for(A a: l1) {  
    C c = new C(a);  
    for(B b: l2) {  
      if (c.foo == b.foo) {  
        c.add(b);  
      }  
    }  
  }  
}  
</code></p>

<p>As is obvious any half-decent programmer would shudder at the thought of writing something like this, particularly let it run on a device with limited resources. A simple way to refactor this would be to create an index for one of the lists and iterate through other.</p>

<p><code>**// merge - version 2**  
function List&lt;C&gt; merge(List&lt;A&gt; l1, List&lt;B&gt; l2) {</code></p>

<p><code>  // create the index  
  HashMap&lt;Foo, Bar&gt; map = new HashMap();  </code></p>

<p><code>  for (B b: l2) {  
    map.put (b.foo, b);  
  }</code></p>

<p><code>  for(A a: l1) {  
    C c = new C(a);  
    c.add(map.get(a.foo));  
  }  
}  
</code><br />
Conventional wisdom says, that version 2 is much better than version 1. Right? Well, what if you have 128 MB of shared memory across your system, but a dedicated processor for your subsystem?! Won&rsquo;t you want to pick version 1 in that case? What if both the lists can have millions of entries? That would render both these cases useless.</p>

<p>Sometimes, before trying to find a technical solution to the problem at hand, it might help to ask why? What is the need for this requirement? The key is to ask why until you reach a specific use-case. I tend to ask this all the way until I reach either a SOAP request, or a specific component in the GUI that requires this piece of data. Most of the time, we can get by without writing a potentially inefficient solution.</p>

<p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/shvelmur/3262859586/"><img src="http://blog.shiv.me/images/3262859586_5caf14c1fb_m.jpg" alt="Lord of his city" /></a></p>

<p>In this case, after several &ldquo;why&rdquo;s, I discovered that this requirement came about, since one of the products in our suite (yeah we have a bunch of products that build on each other), need to display a list of names of object C, as the user searches for a specific one to add items to. If we had decided to write either v1 or v2, every time the user opened that GUI component, we would transport, a possible 10000 records from the device all the way to the GUI (which in our case is several layers above), when we only need a list of names based on a specific criteria.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;how&rdquo; of your design depends the &ldquo;why&rdquo;. The only limiting factor is the willingness to ask why, until you can find an alternate solution, or, are absolutely convinced that there is no other way to acheive a specific requirement without writing some inefficient code &mdash; then defend rigorously against doing it. well, atleast you have to get a some kind of limits in place.</p>

<p>Sometimes you have to <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/shvelmur/3262859586/">stand up to your product manager</a>, and sometimes you have to take a <a href="http://blog.shiv.me/2009/01/28/i-recommend-drinking-vin-chaude-when-youre-in-strasbourg-france/">sip of warm wine</a>, and go write that &ldquo;piece of crap&rdquo; code.</p>

<p>Happy coding!</p>

        <p>Firstly $1000 is not a jackpot, add a couple more zeros and your in my range of a jackpot. :)</p>

<p>Secondly, if I did get a $1000, say on the street, or in an envelope by my door-side from a do-gooder, I would buy this <a href="http://bit.ly/jcL">http://bit.ly/jcL</a> (70-200 2.8L canon mount lens)</p>

<p>Ever wondered how they keep warm in the cold winter months in Alsace?! They heat really good (most of the time) white wine and drink it like tea! And you can get it pretty much in every square!</p>

        <span class="post-date">Sun, Jan 25, 2009</span>
        <p>After several no-vacation years, I ended 2008 with a (short) trip to Strasbourg, France. For much of the last year, I have started  doing things that I have abandoned in the last 8 years. The year has been quite eventful, much of it not evident from the lack of posts (which I hope to correct this year).</p>

<p>After a frantic last-minute scramble for the visa, I managed to get to Strasbourg. I managed to escape the <a href="http://mybootsnme.blogspot.com/2009/01/snowfall-record-for-vancouver-british.html">record-breaking snowfall</a> in Vancouver. Strasbourg was cold, really cold, but is quite beautiful during the Christmas week.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/shvelmur/3209238410/" title="Cathédrale Notre-Dame-de-Strasbourg"><img src="http://blog.shiv.me/images/3209238410_c6a63af4db.jpg" alt="Cathédrale Notre-Dame-de-Strasbourg" /></a></p>

<p>Visited the usual places, and added one more little town, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riquewihr">called </a><a href="http://i-love-riquewihr.com/pt_9.html">Riquewihr </a>to my &ldquo;places visited around Strasbourg&rdquo; list. I really love the tiny towns and narrow streets in Europe. The eagerness of people to go to great lengths to maintain very old building 100s of years old is simply refreshing. Riquewihr is quite the quaint french town, and very touristy indeed. Mental Note: Need to go spend more time there, the next time.</p>

<p>A week with family was so much. There is something about being with family, and not knowing the language they speak (I can&rsquo;t really follow french when spoken at the &ldquo;french speed&rdquo;), that lets you feel at home and by yourself at the same time. It was really nice to see my aunt, uncle and cousins after a few years.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/shvelmur/3208386245/" title="Les Brothers Francais"><img src="http://blog.shiv.me/images/3208386245_85776402ed.jpg" alt="Les Brothers Francais" /></a></p>

<p>It has been 16 years since I held their hands as they took their first steps (I was 11 years then), but it still feels like yesterday. It was quite entertaining to let them lead me around their town! (Thanks guys I really enjoyed the places you took me to, and thanks JF for all the wine and cheese :))</p>

<p>It was an interesting experience, to see the places through eyes that are a few years older (and possibly a little wiser). The only thing I regretted was not spending more than one week there. Something that I found interesting is that as I grow older, things excite me lesser (quite obvious, I know), but somehow, I think allows me to enjoy the present more, and truly live the experience. I guess life is akin to listening to good music. The highs are not as enjoyable, when there are no lows.</p>

        <h1 class="post-title"><a href="http://blog.shiv.me/2009/01/02/are-you-using-open-dns/">Are you using Open-DNS?</a></h1>
        <span class="post-date">Fri, Jan 2, 2009</span>
        <p>You should be using Open-DNS, if you answer yes to one of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Are you frustrated with crazy-long wait times before even the website url shows up?</li>
<li>Is your ISP is a cheapo-*#$% using a crappy machine for DNS, and you wait enough to count the seconds between pressing enter and the little thingy on the browser status bar says &ldquo;done&rdquo;?</li>
<li>Are you subject to phishing attacks?</li>
<li>Do you want peace of mind?</li>
<li>Do you want auto-correction of urls?</li>
<li>Want to block your teen from accessing &ldquo;excessive&rdquo; porn?</li>
<li>Do you need a new dog to carry you paper?</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://www.opendns.com/">OpenDNS</a> is for you (well, for the dog, you&rsquo;ll have to move your ass and get one yourself).  It is quite trivial to setup and really speeds up your browsing speed. You can can set it up for each computer that you use, or better still, change the configuration on your router, which would apply across all machine connected through that router.</p>

<p>Changing the DNS server setting on your router, offers a few advantanges. For instance, you can define your own shortcuts for frequently used sites, and they would apply across all machines in your network. You set &ldquo;mail&rdquo; as a shortcut for &ldquo;<a href="http://gmail.com&quot;">http://gmail.com&quot;</a> and every time you time &ldquo;mail&rdquo; in your browser&rsquo;s address bar, it will be replaced with &ldquo;<a href="http://gmail.com&quot;">http://gmail.com&quot;</a>.</p>

<p>Open DNS also auto-corrects most common spelling mistakes of popular urls. For example, if you type googel.com, it will correct it to <a href="http://google.com">http://google.com</a>. It will also suggest urls when it can&rsquo;t find the correct url. Certain domains can be placed in a black/white list. How cool would it be to let your 15-year old know who is boss for a change?! Ground them for a week or so, denying them facebook access, for instance. Grounding 2.0!</p>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t this enough reason to spend 2 minutes configuring openDNS?! What are you waiting for.. <a href="http://www.opendns.com/">go on</a>!</p>

If you are on your way to Paris, or on the way from Paris, or in Paris, or &hellip; nevermind&hellip; just read this book if you are associated, in any way, with Paris. You&rsquo;ll love it.</p>

<p>(If you are French, read this too, get angry, rebel and then revel in the glory! :) )</p>

        <p>Here&rsquo;s the the top 3 requested features from iPhone users at large.</p>

<p><a href="http://twitpic.com/nt0h"><img src="http://blog.shiv.me/images/nt0h.jpg" alt="Wishlist for fixes on the iphone" /></a></p>

<p>And here&rsquo;s what they thought people wanted.</p>

<p><a href="http://twitpic.com/nt1e"><img src="http://blog.shiv.me/images/nt1e.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Some Product Manager at Apple needs to think how much this is hurting Apple&rsquo;s brand. Do they want to be branded, yet again, as a company that completely ignores their customers?! At least give some indication as to why you can&rsquo;t get the top three features in. Sure they have a lot of less demanding, faithful sheep in their flock, but now they are going mainstream, and they need to get their act together. Come on Apple! Stop making me feel bad about choosing a product by a company that doesn&rsquo;t give shit about what I want.</p>

<p>I hope they don&rsquo;t go the way of the american auto companies.</p>

Too much text and recipes are wantonly complex. A bit contrived, but not as bad as it sounds. A lot of comfort food. This book is about eating well, and not for the health conscious</p>

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Oct 25, 2008</span>
        <p>I got really sick of using Adobe AIR apps that take up more and more of system memory for an app that does twitter.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve decided to put my &ldquo;coding for myself&rdquo; hat on and write a QT based C++ application (that should be cross-platform). No name as yet, but I will find something soon. QtTwitter is taken. Mebbe, once I have a working version, I can get ownership of the project on google code.</p>

<p><a href="http://twitpic.com/i942" title="Share photos on twitter with Twitpic"><img src="http://blog.shiv.me/images/i942.jpg" alt="Share photos on twitter with Twitpic" /></a></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the proposed GUI. Sorry for the bad light. The iphone cam&rsquo;s not too good with tungsten light.</p>

<p>Any suggestions?! I will try and post some mock up as I create em. I don&rsquo;t want to be writing my own twitter REST c++ library. Any suggestion are welcome.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Wed, Oct 15, 2008</span>
        <p>Several people are shocked to hear that I read 1000+ emails and <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/shared/18301612726860782682">several hundred blog posts a day</a>. Ofcourse, when I say that, all I mean is that, I process that much content. I read around 30-40% (That is really the signal-to-noise ratio of web content these days&ndash;and that is, if you are subscribed to high quality feeds)</p>

<p>[caption id=&ldquo;&rdquo; align=&ldquo;alignnone&rdquo; width=&ldquo;450&rdquo; caption=&ldquo;google reader trends&rdquo;]<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/shvelmur/2945049781/"><img src="http://blog.shiv.me/images/2945049781_d005a9184b.jpg" alt="google reader trends" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p>One of friends was curious how I can handle all that data flow, and I emailed her this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Everyday, go to bed with a zero count.</li>
<li>Use tools to reduce your processing. (use email rules/filters to move mails to manageable folders and Google reader for feeds)</li>
<li>Learn to skip-read. I use a 2 parse method.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>Parse through sets of items (email headers or blog post headlines), and mark the ones your need to pay attention to (usually around 40%).</li>
<li>Filter based on short-listed items and then go through them in detail. In the case of blog posts, if something does retain my attention after the first 4 sentences, I skip that item.</li>
<li>(only for blog posts) I mark the ones I have to comment on, and then do my commenting after I finish a folder.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>Sometimes, you just can&rsquo;t squeeze everything in a day, I either bookmark or mail it to myself to be addressed over the weekend.</li>
</ul>

<p>What do you think? Am I missing something that will make my life a little easier?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: Thanks to Aswinanand for pointing this out&ndash;I don&rsquo;t really get 1000+ emails. I was just exaggerating (which is just another way of saying, click-baiting! :) )</p>

        <span class="post-date">Thu, Sep 25, 2008</span>
        <p>One program&ndash;on Food TV&ndash;that I like to watch, is <a href="http://www.gordonramsay.com/corporate/theman/biography/">Gordon Ramsey</a>&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.channel4.com/food/on-tv/ramsays-kitchen-nightmares/">Kitchen Nightmares</a>. He is such a powerful person, who is into what he does for a living. He has inspired me to get of my couch and cook decent food.</p>

<p>This is a recipe from his book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1554700647?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=shvelmurcom-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1554700647">Fast Food.</a> Every guy who wants to cook decent food should have on his shelf. A simple book, with simple recipes that any idiot (aka me) can follow. Most dishes are less than 30 minutes of cooking time.  I&rsquo;m a very imprecise cook, and subtitute freely when I can&rsquo;t find a specific fish or condiment. I have taken the same liberty with this recipe as well.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/shvelmur/2888542655/"><img src="http://blog.shiv.me/images/2888542655_603b2e1c08.jpg" alt="IMG_5494" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>2 skinned Halibut fillets (about 150 gms), or cod, tilapia or turbot</li>
<li>1 tbsp Hot Madras Curry, or any non-sweet curry paste</li>
<li>1 tsp superfine sugar (optional)</li>
<li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
<li><sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> cup (150 ml) plain yogurt</li>
<li>2 cucumbers, peeled</li>
<li>handful of mint leaves</li>
<li>lime juice</li>
<li>2 tbsp of vegetable oil</li>
</ul>

<p>Heat the oven to 400 F (200 C). Mix the curry paste, olive oil, sugar and all but 2 tbsp of the yogurt. Coat the fish with this mixture and set aside for atleast 20 minutes.</p>

<p>Cut the cucumber lengthwise (bâtonnet) and toss in the reserved yogurt, chopped mint and the lime juice. You want to be modest with the lime juice. Too much acidity can mask the taste of the fish.</p>

<p>Sear the fillets on an overproof pan&ndash;setting aside the excess marinade&ndash;for about 1.5 minutes on each side or until golden brown. If don&rsquo;t have an overproof pan, just use any skillet and a pre-heated baking pan.</p>

<p>Spoon over the marinade and place the pan in the oven and cook until done (the insides of the fish turns white and is flaky to cut). Transfer to a warm plate and serve with the cuccumber.</p>

<p>Now, wasn&rsquo;t that simple. Ramsey&rsquo;s a genius in creating simple foods.</p>

        <p>You know something is seriously out of whack, when you download a 12 MB application that is just a step above an ftp application. I know, a rant at such an ungodly hour! Yup! I have been up 2 hours past bed-time trying to upload a few high-resolution photos.</p>

<p>I found these shots of fireworks that I captured about two months back, and finally managed to sneak in some time to process these shots. I started my attempt at putting <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/shvelmur/sets/72157607481830420/">these</a> on my <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/shvelmur/">flickr account</a>, and <a href="http://www.stevey.com/2008/01/12/the-new-flickr-uploader/">the pitiful uploader V3</a>, has been failing for the last 2 hours! I doesn&rsquo;t seem to be the servers, since the 2.5 version works fine. Although, I must confess, I&rsquo;m uploading files that are more than 5MB, and it&rsquo;s really just timeout issues.</p>

<p>What is with this craze for making all desktop applications suck, by re-writing the simplest of desktop apps in  javascript and its ilk I&rsquo;m looking at you, AIR)? It&rsquo;s fine to use these heavy-weight stacks as a stop-gap solution. But, to turn a prefectly <a href="http://techiteasy.org/2007/12/20/bloatware-the-case-of-flickr-uploadr-3/">good app into mush</a>, in the name of multi-platform support is a crime&ndash;no less.</p>

<p>If you want to write multi-platform applications&ndash;use Java or some library like Boost. It also, helps to remember the main functionality, and ensure that works well&ndash;really well. An uploader, should never fail, when &ldquo;uploading&rdquo; stuff, an email client&ndash;should have reliable email dispatch, etc.</p>

<p>I wonder where this will lead us? Maybe 10 years from now, we will end up with a calculator application that will use 100 MB disk spave, and we wouldn&rsquo;t worry about it, coz our computers will have 10 GB of RAM and several  PetaHz processing power or some such crap. I&rsquo;m not really looking forward to a future like that. Maybe, I should start that open source project for a native flick app after all.</p>

<p>Update: They are finally up&hellip;phew! Here&rsquo;s the fireworks collection:</p>
