      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a year since I sold my kidneys for an iPad. It&amp;rsquo;s been fun. It has replaced every other device I own (ie, a couple of PCs and the nexus one). It&amp;rsquo;s an outright winner, when it comes to reading, especially long-form articles, and books alike. It has become my go-to machine for everyday news, twitter/facebook, and even for browsing my favorite photographers.
It have however remained strictly in the realm of content consumption &amp;ndash; until now.</description>

      <description>This is a test post from blogsy, an iPad blogging tool.
The interface design looks thoughtful &amp;ndash; drag &amp;amp; drop of images from flickr and picasa, videos from YouTube, a built it google search and browser to get at other content. Although there is a bit of a learning curve, it makes the iPad a true content generation device.
Maybe this will keep me blogging this time around. On that note, here&amp;rsquo;s a cutie pie to bring a smile to you, today.</description>

      <description>If you weren&amp;rsquo;t in a hole the past few days, you would have heard about the iPad 2 launch. Here&amp;rsquo;s Conan&amp;rsquo;s take on it.
I must say, the cover is a thing of engineering beauty. Kudos on that, Apple, and thanks for screwing over several thousands of your iPad 1 customers, who forked up 9.5 Billion in revenue in 9 months.</description>

      <description>I did it. I said I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t. I said I will hold out for purely ethical reasons, but it is very hard to resist the iPad. The first impression in-store is simply &amp;ndash; awesome. This of course is not a surprise and is something that one can expect from apple these days.
Warning: This is a long post ..
Here are some thoughts, after a day of use:
 It&amp;rsquo;s fast.</description>

      <description>I turned 30 yesterday.
A whole day has passed since I left my 20s. They say it is a big day. They say it is a dreaded day. It was neither. Just busy (which is good).
I chanced upon [Douglas Adams&#39; post][1] from 1999:
&amp;gt; 1. everything that&amp;rsquo;s already in the world when you&amp;rsquo;re born is just normal;
&amp;gt; 2. anything that gets invented between then and before you turn thirty is incredibly exciting and creative and with any luck you can make a career out of it;</description>
