      <description>Google reader is one of Google&amp;rsquo;s products, that didn&amp;rsquo;t you didn&amp;rsquo;t realize you needed until you started using it. Heck, pretty much every product they do is in that category. It is one app where I spend a lot of time every day. That is how I still manage to read blogs. Even after twitter and facebook and friendfeed, GReader is still the place, where you can truly control the signal vs noise ratio of content that you read.</description>
