      <description>Update: Apparently, I had accidentally hit a minor bug in pew. This has now been fixed.
Every so often, we spend several hours battling an issue, fighting linux or python or people or thoughts. The solution, often, leaps out when there has been a respite in the constant search for the solution. It&amp;rsquo;s the &amp;ldquo;duh&amp;rdquo; moment, that all of us feel. There is a little self-loathing, and relief at having arrived at solution.</description>

      <description>Ohh the unix command prompt, I love thee! Can you guess what these commands do?
# grep -l &amp;lt;regex&amp;gt;  # find . -name &amp;lt;regex&amp;gt; -delete  </description>

      <description>Sometimes working with an old c compiler brings up painful, yet fun-filled days of making it speak the same language as you, and sometimes you just go &amp;ldquo;*$&amp;amp;%*$#&amp;amp;% you piece of sh** compiler&amp;rdquo;
I had one such moment today, and after I had returned to Zen (some soul-searching and some google searching), I realized it quite simple.
$ gmake ... ... some_file.h:42: badly punctuated parameter list in \`#define&amp;#39;  some_file.h:64: badly punctuated parameter list in \`#define&amp;#39;  Failed to compile $ This was caused by the following:</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I&amp;rsquo;ve done anything except write code &amp;ndash; lots of it. The last 20 days have been insane, and ofcourse to a take a break from writing code, I like to read code that others write. (You DO know that I&amp;rsquo;m crazy, right?!). In one of my futile attempts at clearing my google-reader reading list, I chanced upon a post by Veerabahu, on finding if a number is a power of 2 (or not).</description>

      <description>An interesting thing for me, is that if I am active on twitter during daytime in India (now that I&amp;rsquo;m here on vacation), I get to have some interesting conversations about design and development. Today, I chanced to talk about the lack of unsigned values support in Java.
    veechand is there unsigned int in #java support your answers 10 Jul 2010  from TweetDeck

      <description>Dave Winer, the inventor of RSS, wrote today about twitter&amp;rsquo;s latest API update for supporting the lists feature
 It turns out there&amp;rsquo;s an API call that retrieves the timeline for a list, and it works exactly like the API call that retrieves the timeline for an account. So much so that I didn&amp;rsquo;t even have to change the glue script, I pass in a different URL and it just worked &amp;gt; orig link</description>

      <title>The devil is in the why?</title>

      <description>Recently I got asked, what the best way to do a join between two large lists, into another list was? I always tend to answer that question with: it depends.
Just like any other algorithm, there is no silver bullet. It is a trade off between CPU and memory utilisation. Sometimes, we do have to think about these things (this is code in c++ on a device with scarce resources, to say the least).</description>
