      <p>Rain, a gallery by Todd Klassy on Flickr.
It&rsquo;s that time of the year, in Vancouver, when it starts to rain and is expected to do so, incessantly, for the next 6 months (I exaggerate, a little).
It is better to be prepared for it, and enjoy it while it lasts (like so many other things in life &ndash; even the moments, that are not exactly the way one wants them to be)</p>

      <p>Last weekend, I went to my first photo-walk in Vancouver. This one is a yearly affair, organized by Scott Kelby. It&rsquo;s called the Worldwide Photowalk (#WWPW), and it was quite exciting. This was the fourth such event (and my first). I met a lot of very interesting people of varied backgrounds. Can&rsquo;t wait for the next one.
Flickr groups for the photo-walk are:
Gastown
Scott Kelby&rsquo;s WWPW4
Thanks to Scott Kelby for starting such a wonderful thing, and letting it grow.</p>

      <p>A couple of weeks ago I started a new project - to shoot random strangers in the streets of GVRD (Greater Vancouver Regional Districts - for those of you that are not from here). I wanted to see if I had the guts to walk up to random strangers, and ask their permission to shoot a picture of them. I was also curious to know how they would react to it, and what my success rate would be.</p>

      <p>to write a blog post, when someone calls you to tell you that they checked your blog, and there was nothing of interest. Ofcourse, being lazy, I just chose to put some pictures, which have been languishing in the netherworld of pictures on the internet &ndash; Picasa.
Looks like, Google has improved picasaweb to be almost usable. It is still void of comments, or any real social aspect. I&rsquo;m still well within the free quota, and I&rsquo;m not forking out money for yet another storage provider, until they provide a way to export all of the content that I generate in a &ldquo;parseable&rdquo; form (That&rsquo;s right, we invent words here).</p>
