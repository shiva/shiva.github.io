      <description>to write a blog post, when someone calls you to tell you that they checked your blog, and there was nothing of interest. Ofcourse, being lazy, I just chose to put some pictures, which have been languishing in the netherworld of pictures on the internet &amp;ndash; Picasa.
Looks like, Google has improved picasaweb to be almost usable. It is still void of comments, or any real social aspect. I&amp;rsquo;m still well within the free quota, and I&amp;rsquo;m not forking out money for yet another storage provider, until they provide a way to export all of the content that I generate in a &amp;ldquo;parseable&amp;rdquo; form (That&amp;rsquo;s right, we invent words here).</description>
