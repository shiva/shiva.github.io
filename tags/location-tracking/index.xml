          <description>&lt;p&gt;And now you&amp;rsquo;ve done it!! Bah! I thought it was so cool that I could plot of heat map of my location for a full year. With &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2011/04/iphone-customers-lawsuit-data/&#34;&gt;all&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://gigaom.com/2011/04/21/researcher-iphone-location-data-already-used-by-cops/&#34;&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; [cribbing][2] around the internets about how the iphone is not secure because it stores data (ie a cache of your location data), Apple has decided to squash this wonderful &amp;ldquo;easter egg&amp;rdquo;.
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; Sometime in the next few weeks Apple will release a free iOS software update that:
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; reduces the size of the crowd-sourced Wi-Fi hotspot and cell tower database cached on the iPhone,&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; ceases backing up this cache, and&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; deletes this cache entirely when Location Services is turned off.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; In the next major iOS software release the cache will also be encrypted on the iPhone.
&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be cool, if someone actually wrote an app that does the exact same thing? I bet it would sell like crazy! I&amp;rsquo;d buy it.&lt;/p&gt;
