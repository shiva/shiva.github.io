      <description>After several no-vacation years, I ended 2008 with a (short) trip to Strasbourg, France.

The year has been quite eventful, much of it not evident from the lack of posts (which I hope to correct this year).
After a frantic last-minute scramble for the visa, I managed to get to Strasbourg.</description>
