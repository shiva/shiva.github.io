          <description>&lt;p&gt;Have I mentioned the long-standing obsession with stationery, especially, fountain pens? Well, it is a bit of problem, really. In the last few months, I have started hoarding them. It started with one&amp;ndash; a Lamy. Once I discovered how one can procure junk on eBay for very little money, I quickly ended up with a selection. As these things go, I suddenly had the increased &amp;ldquo;need&amp;rdquo; for inks that are not blue, or black. Nay, simple colours won&amp;rsquo;t do for the truly obsessed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the result of the latest rotation of inks and pens.&lt;/p&gt;
