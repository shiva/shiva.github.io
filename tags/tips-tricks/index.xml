      <description>After 12+ years, I built a workstation from scratch. Hardware has come such a long way, but that is a post unto itself. Having always worked with Ubuntu and other debian variants it was time to venture into a more lean distro. I picked Arch Linux, on the recommendation of several colleagues. It&amp;rsquo;s been fun. Pacman and Yaourt are great package managers, and the rolling release model ensures access to the bleeding edge all the time.</description>

      <description>In *nix systems, you can make the display, the GUI of an application, appear on another machine. This if often required, when the machine you want to run the application on is in a lab, and you have access through a desktop machine that has a monitor.
You can do this, by running an XServer on the desktop machine and configuring the client (the one where you run your app) with the XServer details.</description>

      <title>How I handle 1000&#43; emails and 300&#43; blog posts a day</title>

      <description>Several people are shocked to hear that I read 1000+ emails and several hundred blog posts a day. Ofcourse, when I say that, all I mean is that, I process that much content. I read around 30-40% (That is really the signal-to-noise ratio of web content these days&amp;ndash;and that is, if you are subscribed to high quality feeds)

One of friends was curious how I can handle all that data flow, and I emailed her this:</description>

      <title>cvs - Getting list of files changed in the current tree</title>
      <link>http://blog.shiv.me/2008/06/23/cvs-getting-list-of-files-changed-in-the-current-tree/</link>

      <description>The simple way to retreive the list of changed files would be to update the tree, which would then list the files updated.
#cvs update . &amp;gt; filelist.dat
The problem with this, is that if there have been changes to other files after your last update, you will have to manually glean the files that you have changed. I tend face this, particularly during the last couple of weeks before a release, since you don&amp;rsquo;t want to risk updating your tree everyday, but still have to make 2/3 checkins.</description>

      <description>I have a dual-boot PC at home, which boots to OpenSUSE and Windows. After a very tiring 7 hour journey, I came home to a GRUB failure. After searching for help all over the web, I found some help here, here, here, here, here and here. :)
It turns out, that GRUB stage 2 was not being loaded. So here&amp;rsquo;s what I did.
1. set the root partition
2. run GRUB setup on the MBR.</description>

      <description>Having broken my elbow, I have spent the last two weeks typing away with a single hand. With nothing much to do, I went about looking at ways to improve the capabilities of blog editors. I use BlogDesk for my blogging needs. It is a wonderful editor, that let you do all operations provided by MetaWeblog API. However I wanted to do more than what was provided there. I wanted to add some features for plugins that I used.</description>

      <description>After what has been ages, I have returned. Not that many are reading this, but I intend to use this for future reference in any case
I have wanted to learn javascript, and this time I found a sustainable way. Learn a language by implementing something very huge in it. I&amp;rsquo;m writing, what I must say a very kewl application at work, and am learning quite a few tricks in javascript.</description>

      <description>I simply love that plugin - Batch categories, like a myriad of other wordpress users. (A thousand thanks to Stephanie Booth wouldn&amp;rsquo;t suffice ;) ), but I had problems getting it to work in 1.5.1
Lots of results out there, that explain how to fix it, but none that lets a newbie get it up quickly. I know this is a repetition, but it still took my more than a day to get it fixed (mebbe it&amp;rsquo;s my dull head.</description>
