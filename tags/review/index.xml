      <title>iPad and friends</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a year since I sold my kidneys for an iPad. It&amp;rsquo;s been fun. It has replaced every other device I own (ie, a couple of PCs and the nexus one). It&amp;rsquo;s an outright winner, when it comes to reading, especially long-form articles, and books alike. It has become my go-to machine for everyday news, twitter/facebook, and even for browsing my favorite photographers.
It have however remained strictly in the realm of content consumption &amp;ndash; until now.</description>

      <description>I did it. I said I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t. I said I will hold out for purely ethical reasons, but it is very hard to resist the iPad. The first impression in-store is simply &amp;ndash; awesome. This of course is not a surprise and is something that one can expect from apple these days.
Warning: This is a long post ..
Here are some thoughts, after a day of use:
 It&amp;rsquo;s fast.</description>

      <title>OPML Editor as a wordpress editor</title>

      <description>This is a test post to see if Dave Winer&amp;rsquo;s OPML editor works with a self-hosted wordpress blog. There is something geeky about seeing crappy fonts on a screen, that makes one want to use a tool more.
I&amp;rsquo;ve known of the OPML editor for a few years now, and have tried several times to find a neat use-case for it in my workflow, and it never had a compelling enough reason for me to stick with it.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been waiting for this for a while now! Gary I hope it is all that I expect it to be. If I don&amp;rsquo;t read this the day I get it, and jump up from my bed at 2 AM crying &amp;ldquo;crush it&amp;rdquo; &amp;hellip; well &amp;hellip; I bet I will.</description>

      <title>In the browser lies the power - Wave 2 of the Google takeover</title>

      <description>Finally it&amp;rsquo;s out in the open. The ultimate weapon in Google&amp;rsquo;s powerchest to combat desktop applications, render the need for a specific platform meaningless - the browser. I guess this has been in the making for the last decade, and here it is. A browser by a company that downloads pretty much most of the internet every day.
If you are still reading this, you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be. Get outta here and read this.</description>

      <title>A web based writer for writing to a blog?!</title>

      <description>WriteToMyBlog.com, is a web-based editor (with a lot of formatting options), that allows you to write to your blog (from another website?!).
First thoughts go like,
&amp;ldquo;wtf?!&amp;rdquo;, &amp;hellip; &amp;ldquo;hmmm.. interesting&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip; &amp;ldquo;I am a web 2.0 junkie?!

The likes
1. Simplicity of the UI interface - neat, allows lots of space for text
2. Integration of Flickr and Youtube (although I would love to see more such services)
3. Zero account creation overhead.</description>

      <description>Well, this is a first post to my blog using Jott, which is a very cool service. It allows you to call a number and talk what you want to post, and post it to your blog. I think it&amp;rsquo;s one of the new tools that really enable blogging. I&amp;rsquo;m just going to try it and see how it works out. listen
