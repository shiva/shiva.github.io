      <description>Just upgraded to OSX Lion. A very slick interface.
Quick Review:
1. Launchpad. Solved previously by Alfred in the GUI, and bash aliases on the command line.
2. Mission Control. Eye-candy. Will probably use it until I get tired of all the moving windows, and stick to Cmd+arrow keys to switch desktops. Maybe normal users will find it useful. But then, most people don&amp;rsquo;t want anything that increases their workflow complexity.</description>
