          <description>&lt;p&gt;In the wild days of 1996, when I got my hands on a computer (it cost about a year&amp;rsquo;s worth of my Dad&amp;rsquo;s salary, and nothing that I am would have been possible but for that sacrifice he made), I was enamored by the ease of content consumption on a computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one year, I went from knowing nothing about the world, to interacting with hundreds of other people across the world, talking about different things, and experiencing new content every day. Ideas in the form of text, video (granted there wasn&amp;rsquo;t much back then), music. That desire to learn new things, and to &amp;ldquo;consume&amp;rdquo; content has not abated in the last decade and a half.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, I was mentioning to a colleague that I had to &amp;ldquo;download&amp;rdquo; a particular album by a new artist since it was unavailable in the US (both iTunes, and in store), and the conversation moved to the ethics of doing such a thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can one, in the world today, justify &amp;ldquo;pirating&amp;rdquo; a song, when there is so many ways of getting, said product?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, the cost of virtual goods (videos, movies, music,  pod-casts, articles) are higher than their perceived value by the consumer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these images on the internet, the cost of storage, distribution, and revenue generation is almost zero. Yet an album is still priced around $10-$20. In such an environment, scarcity is pre-dominantly artificial, whether it created by DRM or regional restrictions or pricing schemes, only serve to fuel piracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my case, I would have gladly paid for it on iTunes, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t available there. It was available on Spotify, but of course, that is not available in Canada (it&amp;rsquo;s only been 3 years since the rest of the world has access to it). So my choice is between being denied access to content I&amp;rsquo;m willing to pay for, or fire up a browser, find the torrent, and download it. Guess which one I chose?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fred Wilson, says it better than I can ever hope to (seems like he had a similar problem, and found the same solution):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understand their muscle memory in terms of the scarcity business model. But restricting access to content is a bad business model in the age of a global network that costs practically nothing to distribute on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;via &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2012/01/scarcity-is-a-shitty-business-model.html&#34;&gt;A VC: Scarcity Is A Shitty Business Model&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We, humans are creative beings, and we will always seek the shortest, fastest, cheapest path to creative content. We can make it illegal, but we can&amp;rsquo;t stop people from reaching out to their fundamental impulses. Perhaps it is time we change the way we have organized how we make money from those impulses.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;Forget perfect pitch. I&amp;rsquo;m so thankful that I can experience a large range of frequencies, and that I have enough hearing ability to distinguish timbre, and tone. Watch the video below, especially at 7:00 minutes. We all must be thankful that we can hear as well as we do. I can&amp;rsquo;t imagine what life would be like without the ability to sense the warmth of a viola rising up in the Brandenburg concertos (BWV 1046) movement 1, or the horns in the 3rd movement of the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;J.S. BACH BWV 1046 Brandenburg Concertos No: 1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Movements 1 &amp;amp; 2: &lt;a href=&#34;http://youtu.be/idvduV2I3o0&#34;&gt;http://youtu.be/idvduV2I3o0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Movements 3 &amp;amp; 4 : &lt;a href=&#34;http://youtu.be/x8AEGLAyMOc&#34;&gt;http://youtu.be/x8AEGLAyMOc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Music from DMU</title>

          <description>&lt;p&gt;DMU (Delete me Uncensored) is a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/groups/censorshipsucks/&#34;&gt;group on Flickr&lt;/a&gt;, that was formed because a few people got pissed at Flickr censoring content. It is a very &amp;ldquo;lively&amp;rdquo; place on most days with a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/groups/censorshipsucks/discuss/72157625675827075/&#34;&gt;lot &lt;/a&gt;of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/groups/censorshipsucks/discuss/72157625780640978/&#34;&gt;colour &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/groups/censorshipsucks/discuss/72157625675599763/&#34;&gt;personality&lt;/a&gt;. Mostly its just a bunch of fine folks that have a common passion (photography), and express their opinions with almost no filters. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to mistake the group for being too rude, but you just have to hang around to &amp;lsquo;get it&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve had a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/shvelmur/sets/72157622838132162/&#34;&gt;on-again off-again DMU addiction&lt;/a&gt; mainly because it feels more authentic to me, mostly because I&amp;rsquo;ve seen how serious they are about the art form, but also take themselves lightly. I chanced upon two very interesting music videos on one of the threads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xxgRUyzgs0&#34;&gt;Living Colour - Cult Of Personality&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
