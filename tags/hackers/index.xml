      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been busy. That doesn&amp;rsquo;t explain my silence on this blog, its but an excuse. A lot of things have been happening, both in my personal and professional life, and I&amp;rsquo;m not at liberty to talk about them. Those are for another day.
I have been writing code - for money, ie - for 9 years now. This obsession started a good 6 years before that. I don&amp;rsquo;t have much to show for it (most of it is copyrighted, or lost across several machines, that weren&amp;rsquo;t mine).</description>
