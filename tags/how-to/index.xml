      <description>After 12+ years, I built a workstation from scratch. Hardware has come such a long way, but that is a post unto itself. Having always worked with Ubuntu and other debian variants it was time to venture into a more lean distro. I picked Arch Linux, on the recommendation of several colleagues. It&amp;rsquo;s been fun. Pacman and Yaourt are great package managers, and the rolling release model ensures access to the bleeding edge all the time.</description>

      <description>In *nix systems, you can make the display, the GUI of an application, appear on another machine. This if often required, when the machine you want to run the application on is in a lab, and you have access through a desktop machine that has a monitor.
You can do this, by running an XServer on the desktop machine and configuring the client (the one where you run your app) with the XServer details.</description>
