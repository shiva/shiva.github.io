      <description>I haven&amp;rsquo;t been very good with rotating the inks in the last year. Having accumulated more than my share of inks, it is time to have fewer pens inked and rotate colors.
I still couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist inking 9 pens! There are 3 pens I&amp;rsquo;m excited about &amp;ndash; 2 parker 51 and a custom pen made out of 10000 year-old bogwood (a gift from Christina).</description>

      <description>Have I mentioned the long-standing obsession with stationery, especially, fountain pens? Well, it is a bit of problem, really. In the last few months, I have started hoarding them. It started with one&amp;ndash; a Lamy. Once I discovered how one can procure junk on eBay for very little money, I quickly ended up with a selection. As these things go, I suddenly had the increased &amp;ldquo;need&amp;rdquo; for inks that are not blue, or black.</description>
