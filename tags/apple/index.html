      <p>There has been an increase in security breaches this year. This past week, two services I use were compromised - Tumblr and Apple Developer Connection. Both services informed me of the security breach, and one made me feel like they cared, and the other one didn&rsquo;t. Perhaps I am reading too much into this, but at the very least, it illustrates how important language is, in conveying how much we care.</p>

      <p>DeWitt Clinton once wrote
 What are the hallmarks of a great engineer? A great engineer is characterized by their intelligence, versatility, creativity, loyalty, passion, experience, vision, dedication, composure, humility, and ability.
 Apart from the &ldquo;humility&rdquo; part, which he never cared for, Steve Jobs was the epitome of that description. We shall miss you Mr. Jobs, especially for that keen sense of doing something perfectly.
RIP Steve Jobs, the maker of beautiful things.</p>

      <p>It&rsquo;s been a year since I sold my kidneys for an iPad. It&rsquo;s been fun. It has replaced every other device I own (ie, a couple of PCs and the nexus one). It&rsquo;s an outright winner, when it comes to reading, especially long-form articles, and books alike. It has become my go-to machine for everyday news, twitter/facebook, and even for browsing my favorite photographers.
It have however remained strictly in the realm of content consumption &ndash; until now.</p>

      <p>And now you&rsquo;ve done it!! Bah! I thought it was so cool that I could plot of heat map of my location for a full year. With all the cribbing around the internets about how the iphone is not secure because it stores data (ie a cache of your location data), Apple has decided to squash this wonderful &ldquo;easter egg&rdquo;.
 Sometime in the next few weeks Apple will release a free iOS software update that:</p>
