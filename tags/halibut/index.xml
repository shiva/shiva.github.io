      <description>One program&amp;ndash;on Food TV&amp;ndash;that I like to watch, is Gordon Ramsey&amp;rsquo;s Kitchen Nightmares. He is such a powerful person, who is into what he does for a living. He has inspired me to get of my couch and cook decent food.
This is a recipe from his book, Fast Food. Every guy who wants to cook decent food should have on his shelf. A simple book, with simple recipes that any idiot (aka me) can follow.</description>
