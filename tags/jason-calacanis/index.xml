      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi Jason,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was writing a post very much on the same lines, when I read your mail. I&amp;rsquo;m on my 3rd ipod, 1st iphone and 2nd MBP (one which I ordered just last week). I don&amp;rsquo;t think I can in the right mind buy another iphone or ipod for the amount of control that apple gets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. Absolutely. This is a no-brainer, that I&amp;rsquo;m frankly surprised that Steve Jobs does not see?! Well not really. Apple has always been a closed company. I was under the impression that Apple was a *hardware* company. This behaviour of blocking other applications from talking to Apple products is not only insane, and unfair to the consumer, it quite frankly against the interest of Apple shareholders. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure that having more ways to access data on Apple devices will have a direct impact on the sales of those products. Any product manager or marketeer who has desgined/sold electronics products will see the sense in this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. Absolutely. And I hope that the FCC hammer comes down quick. With the blocking of the Google App, it becomes a clear case of diminishing the experience of the user. This could be the way out for Apple to end exclusivity deals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3. I don&amp;rsquo;t think it a question of forgiving Apple. The consumer never forgives, he/she just chooses the product that best suits his/her needs. Apple already went through a round of this with the desktop wars and lost bitterly. It&amp;rsquo;s sad that they haven&amp;rsquo;t learnt their lesson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having said all of this, I still love their products, it&amp;rsquo;s their product mgmt that I hate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(This post is a response to a message on Jason&amp;rsquo;s list. If you are not subscribed to &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Calacanis&#34;&gt;Jason Calacanis&lt;/a&gt;, you should be. Go there NOW)&lt;/p&gt;
