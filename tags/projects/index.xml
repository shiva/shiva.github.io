      <description>A couple of weeks ago I started a new project - to shoot random strangers in the streets of GVRD (Greater Vancouver Regional Districts - for those of you that are not from here). I wanted to see if I had the guts to walk up to random strangers, and ask their permission to shoot a picture of them. I was also curious to know how they would react to it, and what my success rate would be.</description>

      <description>A few weeks back, I installed Alex King&amp;rsquo;s Twitter Tools for wordpress. Running it for a few weeks, I found that by lack of posting to my blog, became more apparent that earlier. There are now more &amp;ldquo;twitter&amp;rdquo; posts than the number of posts that I have written myself in the last year or so. How pathetic is that?!
Looks like I have almost lost the need to say something (about anything) and it is about time to shut down this blog.</description>
