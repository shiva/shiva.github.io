          <description>&lt;p&gt;In a moment of mild insanity (actually more like boredom), I decided to watch the last show last night. I was plesantly surprised to find that the movie was playing in 2 theatres @ &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cineplex.com/Theatres/TheatreDetails/C5CEF4DF/SilverCity_Coquitlam.aspx&#34;&gt;Silvercity, Coquitlam&lt;/a&gt;. With all the &lt;a href=&#34;http://news.google.ca/news?hl=en&amp;amp;q=batman&#34;&gt;hype&lt;/a&gt;, and the huge &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cnn.com/2008/SHOWBIZ/Movies/07/20/boxoffice.ap/index.html&#34;&gt;revenue generation&lt;/a&gt; in the first week, the movie does deliver most of what it promises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you start reading the rest of the post, there are few items, that could give away the plot. I wonder if one needs to worry about the plot in Batman. Here&amp;rsquo;s the &lt;strong&gt;short version&lt;/strong&gt; of the review - &lt;strong&gt;watch it if you haven&amp;rsquo;t done so as yet. NOW!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some things I liked:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. The movie is a lot more serious than previous renderings of Batman. Finally, a Batman movie, where you don&amp;rsquo;t have to laugh at Batman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. The Joker (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005132/&#34;&gt;Heath Ledger&lt;/a&gt;) was truly amazing. I liked that he retained the southern sounding voice. Heath shines like diamond, and really stands out in terms of his performance. It is such a pity that the world has lost such a wonderful actor. He could have been this generation&amp;rsquo;s Brando or Pacino. He has set new heights for the Batman villian (Traditionally, the villians have been better actors anyway)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3. Batman is real, he gets hurt and has his flaws, and I don&amp;rsquo;t hear &amp;ldquo;kapow&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;zing&amp;rdquo; during the action sequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4. Makeup was wonderful - both the Joker and Two-Face, are more believable and frightening in their own ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5. This movie has one of the best casts in all Batman movies (For a franchise, that has always had a star cast, this one really get the right people for the roles - remember &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000123/&#34;&gt;George Clooney&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000216/&#34;&gt;Arnold Schwarzenegger&lt;/a&gt; anyone?!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6. Thankfully, no robin - nuff said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now for some things that &lt;strong&gt;could have been better&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. 2:35 mins - the show started at 10:00 PM and ended at 1:00 AM! 3 hours is way too long (even for Indians - we get an intermission for our 3 hour movies).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. Two villians too big for this movie. I thought the villians didn&amp;rsquo;t get enough screen time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3. Two-Face&amp;rsquo;s plot is quite unconvincing, and it&amp;rsquo;s a pity he&amp;rsquo;s killed with such little damage. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001173/&#34;&gt;Aaron Eckhart&lt;/a&gt; is no match for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000169/&#34;&gt;Tommy Lee Jones&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4. I hate the new Batman&amp;rsquo;s voice. What&amp;rsquo;s with the constant growling. I think that&amp;rsquo;s the only flaw with the new Batman. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000288/&#34;&gt;Christian Bale&lt;/a&gt;, should learn to show some emotion through his eyes (wrath, anger, hatred etc). I liked him much better in the first movie. He has shown good promise, and if he does a couple more, I can see him as one of the better Batmans. I must say, the best one (my opinion) was &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000474/&#34;&gt;Michael Keaton&lt;/a&gt;. I always liked the quirky Batman. This more dark Batman, closer to the comic, impresses as well, but yet to prove himself. I think he needs a villian who really pushes him hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, a very enjoyable 3 hours, if you have the penchant for Batman, and can hold the large Combo in your bladder long enough. Must see movie. Don&amp;rsquo;t miss it! Now, check out the trailer. (Kudos to Warner Bros. for providing an embeddable version).&lt;/p&gt;
