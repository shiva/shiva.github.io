      <description>A Year in the Merde by Stephen Clarke
rating: 5 of 5 stars
If you are on your way to Paris, or on the way from Paris, or in Paris, or &amp;hellip; nevermind&amp;hellip; just read this book if you are associated, in any way, with Paris. You&amp;rsquo;ll love it.
(If you are French, read this too, get angry, rebel and then revel in the glory! :) )

      <description>&amp;ldquo;This is it! Its the final straw. We need to do something about it!&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;What is it?&amp;rdquo;, you ask. I am sick and tired of hearing story after story of crazed authority figures, forcing rules upon the common man, rendering life to a boring, monotonous series of security checks and bans and fines. From security at airports, to self-righteous moderation aimed at photographers in public spaces. I am sick of it.</description>
