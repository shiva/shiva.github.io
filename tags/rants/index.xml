          <description>&lt;p&gt;After a long ride from Bangalore, whilst I was sleeping blissfully, some rascal, ran through our house, ate an apple, stole a couple of jars of Pickle (good ones at that), helped himself to the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My Philips DVD player (it was skipping at most DVDs anyway)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An old Sony Tape recorder/player (apparently, some was wrong with it, and needed replacement)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 apple (worth Rs 25, but actually priceless since my wife got it for me)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 bottles of mushroom pickle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 bottle of mushroom, and 1 bottle of (the famous) panchranga pickle (five types of fruit and vegetables)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ohh.. also he chased my cats out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, looks as if nothing else is missing. Only the hollow feeling that someone invaded my den when I was sleeping. That kinda robs the secure feeling that one feels, when one is at home!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whoever you are, you better not get caught, coz I really loved those bottles of pickle! (They were from Punjab - you see) :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update: Apparently, he flicked a pack of cigarettes also!! (He&amp;rsquo;s even helping me quit smoking!!). Also a bottle of after-shave that my wife bought for me!&lt;/p&gt;
