      <description>Donâ€™t smoke (Stay quit!!) : Doing great! There is no desire to smoke. After being a smoker for over a decade, I was very glad to quit, and stay quit. The way I quit this time was quite cliched. I went to Vegas, smoked incessantly for 3 days, and stopped at the end of the trip &amp;ndash; cold turkey. Never went back to it, and quite frankly disgusted by the thought of smoking now.</description>

      <description>Vizify makes a video out of the posts you have made on twitter in the last year. Christina, you are always my #1! Thank you for bringing this to my attention. As any self-respecting nerd would do, I immediately made one for myself. Doesn&amp;rsquo;t the world need yet another summary of meee!!
