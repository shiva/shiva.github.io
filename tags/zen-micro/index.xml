          <description>&lt;p&gt;I wanted to get the pod nano initially, but I chose to get the Creative Zen Micro instead for reasons listed below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why the Nano is a piece of junk&lt;br /&gt;
1. Cracked screens &amp;ndash; heard quite a few reports of that and since I live in India and the Nano cost about 2 as much as it is in the US, I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to risk it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. Flimsy &amp;ndash; the entire player bends with little pressure applied, a little more I&amp;rsquo;m sure I&amp;rsquo;d end up with two pieces! (Definitely not suited for 40deg C and extremely dusty conditions that I have to go through everyday to work and back)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3. Battery replacement costs half as much as the player&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4. about 25% more cost than the zen micro which has about 20% more space&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See more progress on: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.43things.com/people/progress/shvelmur?on=471701&#34;&gt;get an ipod&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
