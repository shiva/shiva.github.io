      <title>Useful bash aliases</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For the past 9 years, I have written C code almost every working day. I primarily use vim as my editor of choice (for about 20 years now). The product that I work on has over 22 million lines of source &amp;ndash; most of it a nightmare. Both cscope and ctags (integrated into vim), allow me to quickly move between files and lookup definitions of symbols, and help in understand the challenge at hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, such large code bases result in very large indexes. A fully indexed ctags file is several gigabytes. Searching for a symbols definition in such situations slows vim down quite substantially. It is vital to isolate and index a controlled portion of the source &amp;ndash; the part that I am interested in today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use the following aliases to build tags files and cscope databases as I need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&#34;https://gist.github.com/shiva/89240cdece79f84867f0feeb9d73f1f5.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throw is the fuzzy find capabilities of the most awesome &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim&#34;&gt;Ctrl+p plugin&lt;/a&gt;, and vim becomes the best &amp;lsquo;IDE&amp;rsquo; out there!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another frequently used command is remove-whitespace. I like to strip trailing whitespace, since it is quite ugly, off-putting when viewing diffs between two versions of a file, or when reading git-diffs and patches. It is a lot more powerful when combined with the ability to list all files that were changed in the last commit. The following command, fixes trailing white-spaces in all of the files that were changes in the last commit.&lt;/p&gt;
