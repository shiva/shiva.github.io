      <description>I ought to resist the temptation of writing posts full of only links to other blogs .. but this one is good
http://www.douglaskarr.com/2007/03/25/selling-news-is-dead/
He talks about how &amp;ldquo;selling news is dead&amp;rdquo;. I thinks he hits the nail on the head with this one. When was the last time, that you read/saw, a news items that was worth buying the newspaper for?
I can hardly remember the time, I needed to pick a newspaper, let alone buy one.</description>

This is amazing.. Imagine being able to have a device implanted in your body, with which you cantrol with your thought, and which will use your brain as a hardrive, and use blood sugar as a battery cell.
Eerie thought envelop me, when I think of what could be?!! Living the matrix ?!!
It is not only the body heat that can be a source of energy (like in &amp;ldquo;The Matrix&amp;rdquo;), even human blood sugar can be harnesed!</description>
