          <description>&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago I started a new project - to shoot random strangers in the streets of GVRD (Greater Vancouver Regional Districts - for those of you that are not from here). I wanted to see if I had the guts to walk up to random strangers, and ask their permission to shoot a picture of them. I was also curious to know how they would react to it, and what my success rate would be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve asked around 14, and 8 said yes. Some of them were not comfortable with their pictures on the internets. I offered them 3 options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pictures don&amp;rsquo;t end up on the internet (emailed to them if they send me an email)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the internet for non-commercial purposes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the internet in public domain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only 2 were ok with public domain. The rest opted for option 2. One didn&amp;rsquo;t want it on the internet at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was an interesting experience, and I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to more such excursions. For the lack of a better name, I chose to call this project : &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.shiv.me/projects/people-of-gvrd/&#34;&gt;People of GVRD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suggestions are welcome. Do you have a better name for the project? Perhaps, thoughts on how I should approach people. Do you think I&amp;rsquo;m insane? Apart from photos, would you be interested in a short blurb about the person? What would you like to know?&lt;/p&gt;
