      <title>Unsigned Arithmetic</title>

      <description>Since my last post, I&amp;rsquo;ve had a couple of replies, a few more tweets, and few minutes of talking about unsigned types in Java, and why it doesn&amp;rsquo;t support them.
I still retail the view that unsigned types are unnecessary for the majority of Java developers. The only kind that should care, are those who deal with network information (like representing an ipaddress or macaddress). Everyone, put down your forks, and do not touch the unsigned.</description>

      <title>Why does Java not support unsigned int? - Part 1</title>

      <description>An interesting thing for me, is that if I am active on twitter during daytime in India (now that I&amp;rsquo;m here on vacation), I get to have some interesting conversations about design and development. Today, I chanced to talk about the lack of unsigned values support in Java.

      <description>Recently I got asked, what the best way to do a join between two large lists, into another list was? I always tend to answer that question with: it depends.
Just like any other algorithm, there is no silver bullet. It is a trade off between CPU and memory utilisation. Sometimes, we do have to think about these things (this is code in c++ on a device with scarce resources, to say the least).</description>

      <title>Proposed GUI for C&#43;&#43; based twitter client</title>

      <description>I got really sick of using Adobe AIR apps that take up more and more of system memory for an app that does twitter.
I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to put my &amp;ldquo;coding for myself&amp;rdquo; hat on and write a QT based C++ application (that should be cross-platform). No name as yet, but I will find something soon. QtTwitter is taken. Mebbe, once I have a working version, I can get ownership of the project on google code.</description>

      <title>Unix: removing duplicates from a file</title>

      <description>Over the last few months, I have re-discovered some unix commands (it&amp;rsquo;s been such a long time)
 Eliminate duplicate lines from a file   #sort -u filename &amp;gt; filename.new
  List all lines that do not match a condition   #grep -v ajsk filename
  Copy contents of two files to one   #cat file1 file2 &amp;gt; file3
  Append output of a command to a file   #cat file1 &amp;gt;&amp;gt; file2</description>

      <title>cvs - Getting list of files changed in the current tree</title>
      <link>http://blog.shiv.me/2008/06/23/cvs-getting-list-of-files-changed-in-the-current-tree/</link>

      <guid>http://blog.shiv.me/2008/06/23/cvs-getting-list-of-files-changed-in-the-current-tree/</guid>
      <description>The simple way to retreive the list of changed files would be to update the tree, which would then list the files updated.
#cvs update . &amp;gt; filelist.dat
The problem with this, is that if there have been changes to other files after your last update, you will have to manually glean the files that you have changed. I tend face this, particularly during the last couple of weeks before a release, since you don&amp;rsquo;t want to risk updating your tree everyday, but still have to make 2/3 checkins.</description>

      <description>After several months of keeping away from updating or changing my website, I broke the fast today. I found a wonderful plugin, sideRSS, which allows display of RSS feeds within a blog&amp;rsquo;s sidebar. As usual, I needed a specific functionality that was not supported the way I wanted it. I hacked it a little bit, renamed the plugin, and posted a custom version for download on my website.
If you need to share Google Shared Items, on your blog, but hate to include javascript (like I do), then use this.</description>

      <description>I had to compare machine hardware today, and found information on that here.
**#prtdiag -v - **Gives hardware information about FSB, Sparc Model, CPU speed, RAM, Harddisks, USB drives (ie. PCI and networking slots) etc.

      <description>I have been twidling with HTTP Persistent connections in the last few weeks. Let me start at the beginning
I needed to replace CORBA in a legacy application with something new. Ofcourse, there are a few alternatives out there, but I needed something very lightweight. The problem had two major parts
 Command Execution - Let the client, execute a function on the server-side and process the output data Eventing - Make clients register for events and wait until some events occur and the server transmits the required objects to the client side.</description>

      <description>Though many disagree, and think of software development as a mundane, non-creative task, as Kevin Carlson@DDJ puts it aptly, it is a work of art!
&amp;ldquo;I suppose the question is this: &amp;ldquo;where are the limits of the scientific approach in software development?&amp;rdquo; I mean, we are, ultimately, talking about an act of creation&amp;rdquo; - Kevin Carlson
(note the nested quotes! ;) )
Many of my non-IT friends have asked, how I keep myself interested and how I stand to sit (pun intended) in front of the PC for such long hours and not get burned out?</description>

      <description>Having joined Novell recently, the opportunity to learn a bunch of new development skills has come up. Novell products make extensive use of the mono platform for applications development.
After 4 long years, I find myself in need of re-learning some windows application development. I tried setting up mono on my windows pc, and encountered some peculiar issues. I had installed mono and then went looking around for an IDE. Well, monodevelop sounded kewl, and tried to get in compiled on windows.</description>

      <description>The much talked about and often cursed part of Java development is Garbage Collection.
I often say, &amp;ldquo;Writing code in Java is easy, but writing good code is extremely hard&amp;rdquo;
I have listed a list of links at the end of this article that provides more detailed information.

      <description>One more little thing that is painfully difficult to do in Java. (I love Java though ;) )
There are two ways of getting it done.
a. Cryptic but sweet! bring on the bit manipulators!
private long getLong(byte[] mbytes) { long lValue =0; for (int i : mbytes.length) { lValue = (lValue&amp;lt; &amp;lt;8) | (mbytes[i] &amp;amp; 0xff); } return lValue; } 
b. painfully slow and created a gazzillon objects (sooo typically Java)</description>

      <description>There is an issue with installing the latest version of boast machine v3.1.
The message displayed during install is this

The problem is due to the following code in install.php
author INT(10) NOT NULL default &#39; &#39;,
This should be changed to

      <description>PHP is an incredibly easy to use scripting language and yesterday I had my first meeting with it.
Yeah, I know I support and fix some issues in wordpress, but that just requires programming knowledge, and not exactly great php exposure. But yesterday, I wrote a small tool to track some timesheet info, in php and the whole thing took about 1.5 hours to complete. Slick UI, storing and retreiving from DB et al!</description>
