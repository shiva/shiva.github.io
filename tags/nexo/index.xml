          <description>&lt;p&gt;Firstly, thanks Scoble.. I think I&amp;rsquo;ll stop reading other gadget/tech sites .. you are my new feed filter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, I got a whiff of yet another web 2.0 (does that even mean anything these days!) application site. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nexo.com/&#34;&gt;Nexo&lt;/a&gt; is a wonderful wonderful site. just as Scoble says &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s Yahoo Groups done right&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took me the whole of 1 min to create my account, invite a few friends and setup my own group. Oh yeah, it also provides me with web-space to put my photos etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I would have loved to see, is a way to integrate this with my exisitng site. It&amp;rsquo;s great that I have a nice dashboard, a place to interact with my friends, but I also want them to read some custom content. If only, I could provide a space where my network could read my RSS from NEXO. I know that&amp;rsquo;s being a bit demanding, but hey it&amp;rsquo;s Web 2.0 time. Integration is the key?! no?!&lt;/p&gt;
