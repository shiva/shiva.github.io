      <description>Vizify makes a video out of the posts you have made on twitter in the last year. Christina, you are always my #1! Thank you for bringing this to my attention. As any self-respecting nerd would do, I immediately made one for myself. Doesn&amp;rsquo;t the world need yet another summary of meee!!

      <description>To the people of Japan, and the world, Lord Tennyson has these words
 Tho&#39; much is taken, much abides; and tho&#39;
We are not now that strength which in old days
Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are,&amp;ndash;
One equal temper of heroic hearts,
Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will
To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.

      <description>If you weren&amp;rsquo;t in a hole the past few days, you would have heard about the iPad 2 launch. Here&amp;rsquo;s Conan&amp;rsquo;s take on it.
I must say, the cover is a thing of engineering beauty. Kudos on that, Apple, and thanks for screwing over several thousands of your iPad 1 customers, who forked up 9.5 Billion in revenue in 9 months.</description>

      <description>Some actors have the incredible talent of keen observation, and Mr Spacey is a master at it. Watch him channeling Pacino around 5:25. In few words, he makes you believe you&amp;rsquo;re seeing the real Pacino. The &amp;lsquo;Christopher Walken&amp;rsquo; is also spot on.</description>

      <description>DMU (Delete me Uncensored) is a group on Flickr, that was formed because a few people got pissed at Flickr censoring content. It is a very &amp;ldquo;lively&amp;rdquo; place on most days with a lot of colour and personality. Mostly its just a bunch of fine folks that have a common passion (photography), and express their opinions with almost no filters. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to mistake the group for being too rude, but you just have to hang around to &amp;lsquo;get it&amp;rsquo;.</description>
