      <description>Update: Apparently, I had accidentally hit a minor bug in pew. This has now been fixed.
Every so often, we spend several hours battling an issue, fighting linux or python or people or thoughts. The solution, often, leaps out when there has been a respite in the constant search for the solution. It&amp;rsquo;s the &amp;ldquo;duh&amp;rdquo; moment, that all of us feel. There is a little self-loathing, and relief at having arrived at solution.</description>
