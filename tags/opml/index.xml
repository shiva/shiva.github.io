          <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a test post to see if &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.scripting.com/stories/2007/02/21/daveWinerBio.html&#34;&gt;Dave Winer&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s [][1]&lt;a href=&#34;http://editor.opml.org/&#34;&gt;OPML editor&lt;/a&gt; works with a [][2][][2][self-hosted wordpress blog][2]. There is something geeky about seeing crappy fonts on a screen, that makes one want to use a tool more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve known of the OPML editor for a few years now, and have tried several times to find a neat use-case for it in my workflow, and it never had a compelling enough reason for me to stick with it. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping that this new wordpress editor tool will make me want to use this more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the first post that I&amp;rsquo;m writing using OPMLEditor, and here are some of the impressions in the first 30 minutes of use. This is by no means a thorough analysis, and is mostly off the top of my head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some cool things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Very simple elegant interface, that let&amp;rsquo;s you focus on writing content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Updating an existing post, is as simple as opening a window, and starting to type. This also allows for micro-updates. As I typed this post, I save atleast 3 times. Since my blog has RSSCLoud and PubSubHubBub (sucky name), every time I hit save, you happen to be online, you will receive an update.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some annoyances:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HTML markup when you decide to mark up your page. Since I&amp;rsquo;m a geek, I guess I don&amp;rsquo;t mind this, although I would like to be able to use my favourite markup syntax, like Markdown.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Non-standard menu layout =&amp;gt; I need to search for stuff. This is pain, until I learnt the ropes a bit (all of 15 mins), and I figured out how to use it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t like to take my hands of the keyboard very often, and I tend to shy away from tools that make me do it. Unfortunately, there are no default shortcuts for the simple functionality like adding a link or making something bold, etc. On the one hand, this means, that I will complete writing all that I want to write and then make it pretty. Although, I might get used to working this way, I would still be able to do most of the annotation using just the keyboard. I hope that there is someway to acheive this. I might be wrong about this, so don&amp;rsquo;t stone me over this. ;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another really annoying thing, every time I press enter, it OPMLEditor starts a new outline, which is great for outlining, but when I try to create a list of items, it sucks &amp;ndash; big time. For instance, see how it is horrible to view this list in the editor. If need to change one element, I will need to look at much more of the text, just to figure out where to change it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.shiv.me/images/user.wordPress.workspace.png&#34; alt=&#34;Screenshot of OPMLEditor&#34; /&gt;
* This can be solved by allowing multiple lines in the editor (using shift+enter), and ignoring those when converting to HTML.
* Images have to handle independant of the post creation. I so, wish that the OPML, can also publish the img with the post, but I think Wordpress doesn&amp;rsquo;t provide XMLRPC API for such upload. I posted the image on this post on dropbox, which to a certain extent mitigates this issue, since all you have to do, is use something Skitch to take a screenshot and move it a public dropbox folder. Right-click the image, and you can copy the public link of that image, in finder. Another Cmd-tab, brings you back to the editing context, and few more clicks later, you have placed your image in the post. It&amp;rsquo;s a pain, but it is better than waiting for the image to upload, etc..
* It creates tables for every item in an outline!! This is going to be a very big problem for me, since this means mixing presentation with data so much, that it will be impossible for me to parse this out later, if I just need to get the data. I don&amp;rsquo;t understand, why what is being done using tables, can&amp;rsquo;t be done using paragraphs instead?! This would also allow, the theme on the site to layout the data in whatever way it deems fit. I wonder if I can change this myself?&lt;/p&gt;
