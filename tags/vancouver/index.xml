      <description>Rain, a gallery by Todd Klassy on Flickr.
It&amp;rsquo;s that time of the year, in Vancouver, when it starts to rain and is expected to do so, incessantly, for the next 6 months (I exaggerate, a little).
It is better to be prepared for it, and enjoy it while it lasts (like so many other things in life &amp;ndash; even the moments, that are not exactly the way one wants them to be)</description>

      <description>Last weekend, I went to my first photo-walk in Vancouver. This one is a yearly affair, organized by Scott Kelby. It&amp;rsquo;s called the Worldwide Photowalk (#WWPW), and it was quite exciting. This was the fourth such event (and my first). I met a lot of very interesting people of varied backgrounds. Can&amp;rsquo;t wait for the next one.
Flickr groups for the photo-walk are:
Gastown
Scott Kelby&amp;rsquo;s WWPW4
Thanks to Scott Kelby for starting such a wonderful thing, and letting it grow.</description>

      <description>to write a blog post, when someone calls you to tell you that they checked your blog, and there was nothing of interest. Ofcourse, being lazy, I just chose to put some pictures, which have been languishing in the netherworld of pictures on the internet &amp;ndash; Picasa.
Looks like, Google has improved picasaweb to be almost usable. It is still void of comments, or any real social aspect. I&amp;rsquo;m still well within the free quota, and I&amp;rsquo;m not forking out money for yet another storage provider, until they provide a way to export all of the content that I generate in a &amp;ldquo;parseable&amp;rdquo; form (That&amp;rsquo;s right, we invent words here).</description>
