      <description>I set myself a goal to write more this year - in fact, I attempted to do so once every week. This required me to look at my blog, which led to the inevitable: small changes in what it looked like, led to general dis-satisfcation with the current solution I have to publish my blog, which quickly ballooned into a whole host of activities.
Let me step back a bit.</description>

      <description>And sometimes, they barely hold your attention. However, the recent acquisition is the former. I got the mammoth of a book, over the weekend; it weighs a ton and I&amp;rsquo;ll be sleeping with it, clutched tight in my hands.
If you already have the tomb by tanenbaum of similar name, the unix programming interface, you probably are not going to glean much value from this one (you can thank POSIX for maintaining a modicum of consistency over the years and some would vehemently contest that).</description>

      <description>A Year in the Merde by Stephen Clarke
rating: 5 of 5 stars
If you are on your way to Paris, or on the way from Paris, or in Paris, or &amp;hellip; nevermind&amp;hellip; just read this book if you are associated, in any way, with Paris. You&amp;rsquo;ll love it.
(If you are French, read this too, get angry, rebel and then revel in the glory! :) )

      <title>Movie Review: The Dark Knight (spoiler alert)</title>

      <description>In a moment of mild insanity (actually more like boredom), I decided to watch the last show last night. I was plesantly surprised to find that the movie was playing in 2 theatres @ Silvercity, Coquitlam. With all the hype, and the huge revenue generation in the first week, the movie does deliver most of what it promises.
Before you start reading the rest of the post, there are few items, that could give away the plot.</description>

      <description>The reason for the respite in my blogging, was my move to a new web-host. After several hours of researching, I decided to go with webfaction.com. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t already visited webfaction, DO IT right now! It has been simply amazing. I love the one click installer, and within hours of getting billed, I got access to my account. It comes with shell access, SFTP, enough space, rails 2.x (just days after it was release), django, wordpress 2.</description>

      <description>Crash (2005) (Widescreen Edition)
Some one tell me what the hell are they talking about in this movie!!!! It is the mind-numbing experience of watching 7 movies at one go.
I must give it to the director though, for tying together each of the sub-plots, but man.. you gotta tell me something by the end of the story!!
