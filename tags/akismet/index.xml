          <description>&lt;p&gt;Me and thousands of other people, continue to use wordpress, one of the leading blog management systems (sounds kewl, eh? ;) ), and proof that is it in fact leading is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.plagiarismtoday.com/2007/04/09/why-wordpresscom-is-virtually-spam-free/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently, &lt;a href=&#34;http://wordpress.com&#34;&gt;Wordpress.com&lt;/a&gt;, has the least spam, compared to other free blog-hosting services. The honored list of competitors, include the likes of google, myspace and AOL, each one of them goliaths! &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Mullenweg&#34;&gt;Matt Mullenweg&lt;/a&gt;, the creator of &lt;a href=&#34;http://wordpress.org&#34;&gt;Wordpress&lt;/a&gt;, associates the success of wordpress.com spam protection to Akismet. This is something that I use now. I used spam-karma before this, which was pretty good, but with Akismet, it is almost zero-management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google, with its wonderful, spam filter on gmail, should be able to do much better, but then, comment spam is a very different ball game.&lt;/p&gt;
