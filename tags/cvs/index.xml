      <description>The simple way to retreive the list of changed files would be to update the tree, which would then list the files updated.
#cvs update . &amp;gt; filelist.dat
The problem with this, is that if there have been changes to other files after your last update, you will have to manually glean the files that you have changed. I tend face this, particularly during the last couple of weeks before a release, since you don&amp;rsquo;t want to risk updating your tree everyday, but still have to make 2/3 checkins.</description>
