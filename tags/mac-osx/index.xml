      <description>Just upgraded to OSX Lion. A very slick interface.
Quick Review:
1. Launchpad. Solved previously by Alfred in the GUI, and bash aliases on the command line.
2. Mission Control. Eye-candy. Will probably use it until I get tired of all the moving windows, and stick to Cmd+arrow keys to switch desktops. Maybe normal users will find it useful. But then, most people don&amp;rsquo;t want anything that increases their workflow complexity.</description>

      <description>With Snow Leopard, Apple has the first time done something that has made me go wow! An almost free OS upgrade. This kinda beats the crap out of paying a couple hundred for Win7.

      <description>I did it! I finally went out and bought myself a mac. I didn&amp;rsquo;t waver. No! Not this time.Ã‚ I knew exactly what I wanted, and I was going to get it, come what may!
I have to confess that I have been pretty critical of Apple andits policies. I still am. Nothing has changed my opinion of Apple as a company, in particular, it&amp;rsquo;s marketing team. The ipod touch price changes lead me to those conclusions.</description>
