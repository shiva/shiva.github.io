      <description>The great G.B Shaw, in &amp;ldquo;Man and Superman&amp;rdquo; (not that Superman), quipped, &amp;ldquo;There is no love sincerer than the love of food.&amp;rdquo; I had a weekend, that reminded me how much I love being fed. It also, reminded me of my wayward ways, in keeping the waistline in check, but I diverge. For this Christmas, I got the most amazing gift &amp;ndash; the gift of an evening out trying out food that tasted, as good as it sounds and looks.</description>

      <description>For the last few months I&amp;rsquo;ve been annoyed. Two or three times a week, I get a flurry of emails from Facebook and twitter claiming that I reset my password. Sounds like a first-world problem? It is. However, I have 4 emails linked to my Facebook account and one to my twitter account. I get on average 15-20 mails a week, and I dutifully dis-avow each one of them.
Then, this happens.</description>

      <description>One program&amp;ndash;on Food TV&amp;ndash;that I like to watch, is Gordon Ramsey&amp;rsquo;s Kitchen Nightmares. He is such a powerful person, who is into what he does for a living. He has inspired me to get of my couch and cook decent food.
This is a recipe from his book, Fast Food. Every guy who wants to cook decent food should have on his shelf. A simple book, with simple recipes that any idiot (aka me) can follow.</description>
