      <description>DMU (Delete me Uncensored) is a group on Flickr, that was formed because a few people got pissed at Flickr censoring content. It is a very &amp;ldquo;lively&amp;rdquo; place on most days with a lot of colour and personality. Mostly its just a bunch of fine folks that have a common passion (photography), and express their opinions with almost no filters. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to mistake the group for being too rude, but you just have to hang around to &amp;lsquo;get it&amp;rsquo;.</description>
