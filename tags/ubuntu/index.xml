      <description>And the timing is perfect. Mr Dell, as it turns out (a little Douglassy, eh? Don&amp;rsquo;t get it, read &amp;ldquo;Salmon of Doubt&amp;rdquo;, the last book by Douglas Adams, pg 27), runs Ubuntu, Feisty Fawn on his home PC. Well, one of his PCs, he has four mamoths with 4GB RAM and a Quadro FX 3500 et al, costing well over $4000. Aparently, he also runs windows as well. Hmmm&amp;hellip; living the high life.</description>

      <description>Marius Oiaga of Softpedia News argues that Windows Vista is more secure than MAC OSX, on the grounds that there are more security patches for MACOSX in a 1 month period. Now, how naive is that?!! Developers at Microsoft are probably just catching their breaths after years of trying to get Windows Vista out of the &amp;ldquo;window&amp;rdquo; (excuse the pun).
Now, why is Mac OSX more secure that Windows. Well, you never need to run as administrator (root, in unix speak) to get all applications to work efficiently.</description>
