      <description>To the people of Japan, and the world, Lord Tennyson has these words
 Tho&#39; much is taken, much abides; and tho&#39;
We are not now that strength which in old days
Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are,&amp;ndash;
One equal temper of heroic hearts,
Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will
To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.
