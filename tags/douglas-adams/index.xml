          <description>&lt;p&gt;I turned 30 yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A whole day has passed since I left my 20s. They say it is a big day. They say it is a dreaded day. It was neither. Just busy (which is good).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I chanced upon [Douglas Adams&amp;rsquo; post][1] from 1999:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; 1. everything that&amp;rsquo;s already in the world when you&amp;rsquo;re born is just normal;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; 2. anything that gets invented between then and before you turn thirty is incredibly exciting and creative and with any luck you can make a career out of it;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; 3. anything that gets invented after you&amp;rsquo;re thirty is against the natural order of things and the beginning of the end of civilisation as we know it until it&amp;rsquo;s been around for about ten years when it gradually turns out to be alright really.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; Apply this list to movies, rock music, word processors and mobile phones to work out how old you are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, Point 3 is intensely scary. I have lived all my life being on the bleeding edge (as much as I could afford, atleast). I&amp;rsquo;ve always been in constant search of tools and technology that will make every living moment better than the one before. It has been an affliction, but one that I have throughly enjoyed, and internalised even!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that I continue to do that for the next decade (and prove Douglas Adams&amp;rsquo; wrong). A few posts ago, I took a partly political stand against the [ipad][3], and decided to not vote for it with my wallet. I have also been [vocal][2], about my distaste with Apple&amp;rsquo;s lock-down of the app deployment on the iphone and ipad. In the last few weeks, I&amp;rsquo;m starting to question myself. Maybe it is an effect of #3, as DNA pointed out. But then, this is could just be my way out, a way to weasel from [the stand][2] I took ;)&lt;/p&gt;
