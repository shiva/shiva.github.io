      <description>I turned 30 yesterday.
A whole day has passed since I left my 20s. They say it is a big day. They say it is a dreaded day. It was neither. Just busy (which is good).
I chanced upon [Douglas Adams&#39; post][1] from 1999:
&amp;gt; 1. everything that&amp;rsquo;s already in the world when you&amp;rsquo;re born is just normal;
&amp;gt; 2. anything that gets invented between then and before you turn thirty is incredibly exciting and creative and with any luck you can make a career out of it;</description>
