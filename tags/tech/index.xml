      <description>well not really! I just turned on RSSCloud support on this blog&amp;rsquo;s feed. RSSCloud allows the feedreader subscribing to you, to setup a callback address, which your blog will call whenever you publish something. If every blog does the same, it could account for several thousand, if not million CPU cycles due to lesser polling. It is the brain-child of Dave Winer, the man who invented RSS, the author of the ever-popular scriptingnews blog.</description>

      <description>I discovered today, that twitter+zooomr+a small utility called Cropper, now allows us to put new information about some of the products we use often, out into the blogosphere (I hate that word now), faster than ever before.
Check this image that I posted this image on zooomr on 12th Dec and then twittered it.
I found a blog post, by (I presume) one of the engineer&amp;rsquo;s who made it happen, on the google&amp;rsquo;s official blog.</description>
