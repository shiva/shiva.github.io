    <p>You know something is seriously out of whack, when you download a 12 MB application that is just a step above an ftp application. I know, a rant at such an ungodly hour! Yup! I have been up 2 hours past bed-time trying to upload a few high-resolution photos.</p>
<p>I found these shots of fireworks that I captured about two months back, and finally managed to sneak in some time to process these shots. I started my attempt at putting <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/shvelmur/sets/72157607481830420/">these</a> on my <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/shvelmur/">flickr account</a>, and <a href="http://www.stevey.com/2008/01/12/the-new-flickr-uploader/">the pitiful uploader V3</a>, has been failing for the last 2 hours! I doesn&rsquo;t seem to be the servers, since the 2.5 version works fine. Although, I must confess, I&rsquo;m uploading files that are more than 5MB, and it&rsquo;s really just timeout issues.</p>

<p>What is with this craze for making all desktop applications suck, by re-writing the simplest of desktop apps in  javascript and its ilk I&rsquo;m looking at you, AIR)? It&rsquo;s fine to use these heavy-weight stacks as a stop-gap solution. But, to turn a prefectly <a href="http://techiteasy.org/2007/12/20/bloatware-the-case-of-flickr-uploadr-3/">good app into mush</a>, in the name of multi-platform support is a crime&ndash;no less.</p>
<p>If you want to write multi-platform applications&ndash;use Java or some library like Boost. It also, helps to remember the main functionality, and ensure that works well&ndash;really well. An uploader, should never fail, when &ldquo;uploading&rdquo; stuff, an email client&ndash;should have reliable email dispatch, etc.</p>
<p>I wonder where this will lead us? Maybe 10 years from now, we will end up with a calculator application that will use 100 MB disk spave, and we wouldn&rsquo;t worry about it, coz our computers will have 10 GB of RAM and several  PetaHz processing power or some such crap. I&rsquo;m not really looking forward to a future like that. Maybe, I should start that open source project for a native flick app after all.</p>
<p>Update: They are finally up&hellip;phew! Here&rsquo;s the fireworks collection:</p>
