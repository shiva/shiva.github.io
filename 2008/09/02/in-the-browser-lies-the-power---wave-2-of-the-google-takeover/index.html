  <h1 class="post-title">In the browser lies the power - Wave 2 of the Google takeover</h1>
  <span class="post-date">Tue, Sep 2, 2008</span>
  <p>Finally it&rsquo;s out in the open. The ultimate weapon in Google&rsquo;s powerchest to combat desktop applications, render the need for a specific platform meaningless - the browser. I guess this has been in the making for the last decade, and here it is. A browser by a company that downloads pretty much most of the internet every day.</p>

<p>If you are still reading this, you shouldn&rsquo;t be. Get outta here and <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/09/fresh-take-on-browser.html#">read this</a>. (Actually just open in a new window, and continue reading this).</p>

<p>I guess it makes a lot of sense for a company like Google to have an install base of their own, and what better way than, what has become the primary application on most computers, the browser. With Google&rsquo;s data processing and storage capabilities, I can&rsquo;t begin to imagine the things that could be done with a browser like this.</p>

<p>Some unique things about (I stand corrected, David) Key features of Google Chrome (such a lame name .. come on guys you can be a bit more creative than that &ndash; too many Mozilla hackers @ Google?!), as mentioned in their <a href="http://www.google.com/googlebooks/chrome/">cartoon booklet</a> (if you care to read thru 40 pages), include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Tabs to the top (ignore that - such a cosmetic change) - Aparently this has been around for a while in Opera - thanks David Sheen</li>
<li>Tabs as <a href="http://www.google.com/googlebooks/chrome/images/4.jpg">separate processes</a> (that&rsquo;s good in a way, but I&rsquo;m not so sure about older machines)</li>
<li>New <a href="http://www.google.com/googlebooks/chrome/images/7.jpg">garbage collection engine. </a></li>
<li>New <a href="http://www.google.com/googlebooks/chrome/images/14.jpg">javascript virtual machine</a>, that supports <a href="http://www.google.com/googlebooks/chrome/images/15.jpg">compiled javascript</a> - I want to see the performance on that.</li>
<li>Apparently, they have a huge testbed, that can <a href="http://www.google.com/googlebooks/chrome/images/10.jpg">test each browser build</a> automatically using a hundred monkeys. (I don&rsquo;t care too much about this, I just think this is over-engineering, but hey, this is me).</li>
<li>Uses <a href="http://www.google.com/googlebooks/chrome/#">Webkit for page-rendering</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.google.com/googlebooks/chrome/images/18.jpg">Persistant tab state</a>, and the tab can be detached as well, into a new window.</li>
<li>Standard <a href="http://www.google.com/googlebooks/chrome/images/19.jpg">auto-completing address bar</a> (Firefox 3)</li>
<li>Personalised start page <a href="http://www.google.com/googlebooks/chrome/images/21.jpg">with your browsing history, google info etc.</a></li>
</ul>

<p>As a write this, a huge array of ideas come to mind, that will surely come to be common-place in next few years. I&rsquo;m throwing out some general ideas here, and maybe I&rsquo;ll come back a few years and tick some of them down.</p>

<ol>
<li>Personalised homepages with per-user google content (this is already present in their beta vision)<br /></li>
<li>Single sign-on using open id and o-auth using google account information (read as identity management)</li>
<li>Social networking (submit to orkut etc), location aware</li>
<li>Voice calls from the browser (gtalk, jaiku etc)</li>
<li>Content tagging services, using collective intelligence (this could make google searches much better than they already are - something like mahalo + google, just that every click could potentially give google data, thereby bettering the result match for you.)</li>
</ol>

<p>That&rsquo;s my five things google could do. What do you think? What could Google add to their browser, that willl change the way we use it in the next 5 years?</p>
