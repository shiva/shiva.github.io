    <p>In a moment of mild insanity (actually more like boredom), I decided to watch the last show last night. I was plesantly surprised to find that the movie was playing in 2 theatres @ <a href="http://www.cineplex.com/Theatres/TheatreDetails/C5CEF4DF/SilverCity_Coquitlam.aspx">Silvercity, Coquitlam</a>. With all the <a href="http://news.google.ca/news?hl=en&amp;q=batman">hype</a>, and the huge <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/SHOWBIZ/Movies/07/20/boxoffice.ap/index.html">revenue generation</a> in the first week, the movie does deliver most of what it promises.</p>
<p>Before you start reading the rest of the post, there are few items, that could give away the plot. I wonder if one needs to worry about the plot in Batman. Here&rsquo;s the <strong>short version</strong> of the review - <strong>watch it if you haven&rsquo;t done so as yet. NOW!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Some things I liked:</strong></p>
<p>1. The movie is a lot more serious than previous renderings of Batman. Finally, a Batman movie, where you don&rsquo;t have to laugh at Batman.</p>
<p>2. The Joker (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005132/">Heath Ledger</a>) was truly amazing. I liked that he retained the southern sounding voice. Heath shines like diamond, and really stands out in terms of his performance. It is such a pity that the world has lost such a wonderful actor. He could have been this generation&rsquo;s Brando or Pacino. He has set new heights for the Batman villian (Traditionally, the villians have been better actors anyway)</p>
<p>3. Batman is real, he gets hurt and has his flaws, and I don&rsquo;t hear &ldquo;kapow&rdquo; or &ldquo;zing&rdquo; during the action sequences.</p>
<p>4. Makeup was wonderful - both the Joker and Two-Face, are more believable and frightening in their own ways.</p>
<p>5. This movie has one of the best casts in all Batman movies (For a franchise, that has always had a star cast, this one really get the right people for the roles - remember <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000123/">George Clooney</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000216/">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a> anyone?!)</p>
<p>6. Thankfully, no robin - nuff said.</p>
<p>Now for some things that <strong>could have been better</strong></p>
<p>1. 2:35 mins - the show started at 10:00 PM and ended at 1:00 AM! 3 hours is way too long (even for Indians - we get an intermission for our 3 hour movies).</p>
<p>2. Two villians too big for this movie. I thought the villians didn&rsquo;t get enough screen time.</p>
<p>3. Two-Face&rsquo;s plot is quite unconvincing, and it&rsquo;s a pity he&rsquo;s killed with such little damage. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001173/">Aaron Eckhart</a> is no match for <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000169/">Tommy Lee Jones</a>.</p>
<p>4. I hate the new Batman&rsquo;s voice. What&rsquo;s with the constant growling. I think that&rsquo;s the only flaw with the new Batman. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000288/">Christian Bale</a>, should learn to show some emotion through his eyes (wrath, anger, hatred etc). I liked him much better in the first movie. He has shown good promise, and if he does a couple more, I can see him as one of the better Batmans. I must say, the best one (my opinion) was <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000474/">Michael Keaton</a>. I always liked the quirky Batman. This more dark Batman, closer to the comic, impresses as well, but yet to prove himself. I think he needs a villian who really pushes him hard.</p>
<p>All in all, a very enjoyable 3 hours, if you have the penchant for Batman, and can hold the large Combo in your bladder long enough. Must see movie. Don&rsquo;t miss it! Now, check out the trailer. (Kudos to Warner Bros. for providing an embeddable version).</p>
