Check out the new IM from Google.. neat sparse interface as usual. Extremely intuitive and very light on system resources. I'm lovin' it!</p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2005/08/obl-2005">OBL 2005</a></h1>

    <div id="post">
      <p>OBL - Out about learning, the second time to the same place, same people, but totally a new experience. On a deeper note, I rediscovered myself! Quite a few things about myself, that I hadn't noticed before came to light.</p>
<p>I had a great time too, meeting a few new people, and a few new versions of old ones!<br />
The day we were returning to Chennai, we went to  a kewl pub called "Alibi" in Church Street, where we managed to get two free pitchers of beer (try the Castle beer there ... really neat!)</p>
<p>I am in the process of selecting and uploading some photos. Comeback later for the url</p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2005/07/five-point-someone">Book review: Five point someone</a></h1>

    <div id="post">
      <p>I'm at office, after an all-nighter! I chanced to come by this amazing un-put-downable book by name "Five point someone" by Chetan Bhagat (Check out <a href="http://www.fivepointsomeone.com" target="_blank">the book's site</a>). Not many books that I read get read, in a day.The amazing story of three friends through life at IIT, brought back memories that had been shelved for the past four years. Of the gazillion trees that were felled for the books I have bought, read and enjoyed, the trees that made this book lost their lives to a worthy cause.</p>
<p>Bhagat, hats off to you, for<br />
- putting a smile on my face<br />
- kindling some of the fond memories of collegiate life<br />
- Hari, Alok and Ryan, my friends for a lifetime<br />
- being such a gifted writer<br />
- getting me back in touch with life</p>
<p>There.. I'm a five pointer too! ;)</p>

    <div id="post">
      <p>I encountered, by far, the sickest website I have seen in my entire life.<br />
Kittyculture is the act of stuffing a sweet little kitten into a jar, sealing its anus shut and feeding it to a tube, and keeping it that way for 4 weeks and more, so that it may be given "fair" treatment by giving it an "unique" shape that nature has denied it!! Wow, I just read what I wrote and the absurdity just baffles me! How can anyone in their sane mind can even dream up something like this!!</p>
<p>I personally feel very ashamed having to link to this site, but do so with great melancholy, just so that you can see it too, and sign this petition and stop it.</p>
<p>Please do visit it <a href="http://www.bonsaikitten.com/" target="_blank">here</a>, but only for the purpose of understanding how heinous man has become! How torturous we are towards our fellow creatures that nature has created.</p>
<p>and sign the petition against it <a href="http://www.thepetitionsite.com/takeaction/375646989" target="_blank">here</a></p>
