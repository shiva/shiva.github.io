    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2005/11/the-zen-feeling">The zen feeling!</a></h1>

    <div id="post">
      <p>Atlast!!! Finally!! I got to lay my hands on the Creative Zen Micro I have been drooling over all these days! One of Guru's friend's finally agreed to get it here.</p>
<p>It is much smaller that I thought it would be, but it is one of the coolest gadgets I have laid my hands on. None of the images on the web do any justice to the drool value of this pod-killer. The only disappointment until now, has been the need to shell out $40 for the charger, which I haven't bought as of now. Need to find out how much they would fleece me for it in India.</p>
<p>Along with the zen, came the really kewl Sennheiser. All I can say is that, it is german audio engineering at its very best. The audio fidelity of these headphones are simply amazing.</p>
<p>Check out these links for more information on the above mentioned kewl gadgets:<br />

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2005/10/natures-wrath-2">Nature’s wrath #2</a></h1>

    <div id="post">
      <p>Wowie!!! Yippeee!!! Yikes!!!<br />
That's the sequence of emotional states that I have transitioned through over the last couple of days. Getting some rains after a long period of drought was nice, but then like most things in Chennai, it turns out a teeny weeny bit much, when I have to waddle through knee deep slush!</p>
<p>Torrentials rains have gripped Chennai, for the last couple of days and today life came to a stand-still! Water logging everywhere, no power, nowhere to go to eat! More has been predicted for the weekend! Let's hope chennai is not submerged by the time I get back from Diwali holidays</p>
<p>Like my new found pals in TAC put it, "This is a city of extremes!!". He was telling me today, about the food you can get in chennai, it is either way to spicy, or no spice at all, the deserts are way to sweet to have a second bite, or absolutely zero sweetness?!</p>
<p>Yup mate, it a city of extremes, it can be 45 degrees C in summer, the will dry up the moisture in your blood (I'm just exaggerating here), or it can be torrential rains like this!! Well, despite all this, the city has a charm that most cities I have seen seem to have a lost. It is a big city, and yet you would still find that odd gentleman, who takes the time to stop and give you directions when you are lost, that friendly auto-rickshaw guy, you can within the span of 15 mins give you all that has been happening in Chennai in the last month!</p>
<p>Chennai, I have fallen for thee! Yup you are the "Venice of Asia" although it might be so for only 3 days in 10 years!</p>

      <p>Have you heard about the latest ipod.</p>
<p>http://www.bbspot.com/News/2005/01/new_ipod_implant.html<br />
http://news.com.com/5208-7354-0.html?forumID=1&threadID=4129&messageID=24004&start=-1</p>
<p>This is amazing.. Imagine being able to have a device implanted in your body, with which you cantrol with your thought, and which will use your brain as a hardrive, and use blood sugar as a battery cell.</p>
<p>Eerie thought envelop me, when I think of what could be?!! Living the matrix ?!!<br />
It is not only the body heat that can be a source of energy (like in "The Matrix"), even human blood sugar can be harnesed!</p>
<p>This better be a hoax, or I will have to shave my head for that pod implant and create space on the back of my skul for a USB port! Scary to think, that the next upgrade will have to be my brain (for lack of storage space!!)</p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2005/10/natures-wrath">Nature’s wrath</a></h1>

    <div id="post">
      <p>What are we humans against the over-powering wrath of mother nature? Time and again, she warns, and tests the best of us, and ceases to amaze us with the brute diplay of power. With all the technology in the world, man still has to grapple with reality of the powerlessness of the human being against forces of nature.</p>
<p>The recent display, in Pakistan and its surrounding, is simply astounding. One cannot, but feel empathy towards the innocent thousand (maybe millions) that have been trampled upon by the brute force of a 7.2 Earthquake.</p>
<p>Check some really thought provoking and heart kindling articles on the net<br />

<p>My heart goes out to all the innocent souls that have lost their homes, their livelyhood and dear ones to one of the worst quakes in the last decade.</p>

      <p>SNMP being the bread and butter for me, I decided to dig up some tutorials and links regarding the same.<br />
For the uninitiated, SNMP is short for Simple Network Management Protocol, and is a protocol used to manage network devices such as routers, switches etc.</p>
