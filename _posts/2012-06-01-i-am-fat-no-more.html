<p>BMI, is not the best measure of health, or fitness, but >30 is a definite indicator of lack of care about one’s health. After several years of exactly that, I’m finally within reasonable limits. My BMI is 24.0; It’s official, I’m <a href="http://www.nhlbisupport.com/bmi/">not obese anymore</a>.</p>
<p>In the last 4 years, I have seen my weight go from 230 lbs to 266 lbs, and back to 202 lbs, as of today.</p>
<p>It’s a good day!</p>
