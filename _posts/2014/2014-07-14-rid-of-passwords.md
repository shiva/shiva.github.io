I hate passwords. Seems like several smart people are on the case of getting rid of the "password"

 * Lucas Gonze, argues the [loss of meaning][1] around design of user authentication mechanisms.
 * A world without passwords! How will we identify each other? [Exchange tokens][2]. [Make "forgot password" the default][3]. 
 * [Passwords are the new pay-wall][4].
 * A non-violent protest against the cruel overlord --- the "password". Justin Balthrop, [calls for a boycott][5] .
 * [Several][6] [alternatives][7] to identify users --- promoting password-less login in your apps.
 * Eran Hammer --- OAuth founder --- [gave up on OAuth 2.0][8]. (An old link). Tim Bray [didn't take kindly][9] to that post. Ahh IETF! You can grind the smartest minds to pulp. :)
