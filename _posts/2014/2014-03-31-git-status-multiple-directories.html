At any given time, I have a handful of git repositories that I work on. While typing in the command-line is great, it getting tiring when you have a several directories that you have to manually change to and check. The "git status" command can take the git repo and the working directory as input. That, and a little bash programming to the rescue.

The following command, executes git status in every subdirectory that is a git repository.

{% highlight bash %}
# for d in `find . -name ".git"`; do  
> echo "processing $d ..."; 
> git --git-dir=$d --work-tree=$d/.. status; done
{% endhighlight %}
