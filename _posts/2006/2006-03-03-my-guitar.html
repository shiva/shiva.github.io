<p>well, about a coupla months back, I got myself a guitar and having been since then, utting my fingers at it on and off (mostly after midnight).</p>
<p>I have finally learnt how to play a few bars of "Ilaya Nila", the song that really pushed me towards learning the guiatr in the first place.</p>
<p>After numerous attempts to find the notes myself and failing quite miserably at that, I found this amazingly true reproduction of the original,  <a target="_top" href="http://www.wholenote.com/default.asp?src=l&l=8646&p=1">Guitar Lesson #8646 at WholeNote: Ilaya Nila</a> by Ananth Narayanan. Kudos to you dude!</p>
<p>I simply love that song. Ohh yeah, btw I just turned my fingeres sore, over that last interlude!</p>
