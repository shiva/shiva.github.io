<p><a href="http://www.allconsuming.net/item/view/1497807">The Alchemy of Desire</a></p>
<p>by Tarun J. Tejpal</p>
<p>This is an amazing amazing book. What prose?! and what a story?! This has rekindled my faith in Indian authors, Finally a book in â€œenglishâ€ by an Indian author, without a thousand transliterated words from Hindi.</p>
<p>It has made me see a few things I had forgotten, made me look and find new things, that I didnâ€™t knew existed.</p>
<p>Thank you Tarun, you need to write more!</p>
