<div>Some one tell me what the hell are they talking about in this movie!!!! It is the mind-numbing experience of watching 7 movies at one go.</p>
<p>I must give it to the director though, for tying together each of the sub-plots, but man.. you gotta tell me something by the end of the story!!</p></div>
