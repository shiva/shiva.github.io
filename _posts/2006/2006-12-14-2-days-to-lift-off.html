<p>As with <a target="_blank" href="http://discovery.nasa.gov/">Discovery</a>, after a lot of hurdles (some within me and some otherwise), here I am about to take-off on yet another journey, that, I hope is going to be as exciting as the last one that I took, when I joined <a target="_blank" href="http://newsroom.cisco.com/dlls/global/asiapac/news/2006/pr_02-27.html">HCL-Cisco ODC</a>. I has been an amazing experience in the last week or so, when I have been reminiscing about what I am about to do, what I have done, the wonderful people that I encountered and worked with, and the good and bad times.</p>
<p>Loads of work ahead! So I'm hoping that I will get a day to myself. I got too many people that I need to say farewell to, in person!</p>
