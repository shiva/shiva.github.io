<p>I ought to resist the temptation of writing posts full of only links to other blogs .. but this one is good</p>

<p>He talks about how "selling news is dead". I thinks he hits the nail on the head with this one. When was the last time, that you read/saw, a news items that was worth buying the newspaper for?</p>
