<p>Today has been a very sad day. I bid farewell to Mr Subramaniam.<br />
<br />He was my grandfather's nephew and has been my a great inspiration to me in my life. One of the bravest and knowledgeable persons I have known. One who lived through life with conviction and was as clear at heart as they come.</p>
<p>He has always been there for my family at good and bad times.<br />
<br />A devout and practising Hindu, and a learned man in vedic chants, I have always envied him of having lived in my grandfather's company. I think, what I know about my grandpa, is what "mani thatha" (what I used to call him) has told me of. Having lived in the pre-independance era, he has offered many insights into the lives of my forefathers.</p>
<p>You shall be remembered and your words cherished forever in our hearts. I wish your soul to rest in peace. Adieu my dear "mani thatha"</p>
