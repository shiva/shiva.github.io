<p><a href="http://writetomyblog.com/">WriteToMyBlog.com</a>, is a web-based editor (with a lot of formatting options), that allows you to write to your blog (from another website?!).</p>
<p>First thoughts go like,</p>
<p>"wtf?!", ... "hmmm.. interesting"... "I am a web 2.0 junkie?!</p>
<p><a title="writetomyblog-dot-com" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/22535384@N00/2551244392"><img src="/images/2551244392_1822e5a281.jpg" alt="writetomyblog-dot-com" /></a></p>
<p><strong>The likes</strong></p>
<p>1. Simplicity of the UI interface - neat, allows lots of space for text</p>
<p>2. Integration of Flickr and Youtube (although I would love to see more such services)</p>
<p>3. Zero account creation overhead. (I wrote this post, before I created the account to publish it, and is a 1-click process.)</p>
<p><strong>The dislikes</strong></p>
<p>1. No keyboard shortcuts.</p>
<p>2. Too many formatting options. I would rather have more external services (quote pownce or twitter conversations, facebook, vimeo and other photo and video sites)</p>
<p>3. popups (need I say more.. in this day and age.. popups for functionality is a sin ... almost).</p>
<p>4. A few irksome bugs. (undo doesn't work in-order, flickr requires login name, cursor disappears after including a picture.. etc)</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The service offers what should be part of any good bloggingsoftware. With recent improvements in Wordpress Dashboard and Editor, I doubt if this tool will be able to keep my attention for long. The whole concept of logging into one site for writing to another, seems a little weird. I don't really understand the use-case.</p>
<p><strong>Update: I found a few more bugs</strong></p>
<p>- Editing an existing post, ignore all previous indentation (white-space).</p>
<p>- Tags set are technocrati tags, and not wordpress tags (I guess this is more like a feature request than a bug)</p>
<p>I couldn't find a getsatifaction account for this tool, and hence have sent a traceback to their blog. Mark, if you come this way, do create and account for your product/company at <a href="http://getsatisfaction.com">getsatisfaction.com</a>, and do set up some form of bug tracking system, so that your users can be your testers :). Btw, you are welcome for the bugs mentioned here. Ohh.. btw.. I'm using Firefox on Mac OSX.</p>
