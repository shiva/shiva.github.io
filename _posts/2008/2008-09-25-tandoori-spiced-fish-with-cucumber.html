<p>One program--on Food TV--that I like to watch, is <a href="http://www.gordonramsay.com/corporate/theman/biography/">Gordon Ramsey</a>'s <a href="http://www.channel4.com/food/on-tv/ramsays-kitchen-nightmares/">Kitchen Nightmares</a>. He is such a powerful person, who is into what he does for a living. He has inspired me to get of my couch and cook decent food.</p>
<p>This is a recipe from his book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1554700647?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=shvelmurcom-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1554700647">Fast Food.</a> Every guy who wants to cook decent food should have on his shelf. A simple book, with simple recipes that any idiot (aka me) can follow. Most dishes are less than 30 minutes of cooking time.  I'm a very imprecise cook, and subtitute freely when I can't find a specific fish or condiment. I have taken the same liberty with this recipe as well.</p>
<p><a class="tt-flickr tt-flickr-Medium" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/shvelmur/2888542655/"><img class="alignnone" src="/images/2888542655_603b2e1c08.jpg" alt="IMG_5494" width="500" height="333" /></a> </p>
<p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>2 skinned Halibut fillets (about 150 gms), or cod, tilapia or turbot</li>
<li>1 tbsp Hot Madras Curry, or any non-sweet curry paste </li>
<li>1 tsp superfine sugar (optional)</li>
<li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
<li>2/3 cup (150 ml) plain yogurt</li>
<li>2 cucumbers, peeled</li>
<li>handful of mint leaves</li>
<li>lime juice</li>
<li>2 tbsp of vegetable oil</li>
</ul>
<p>Heat the oven to 400 F (200 C). Mix the curry paste, olive oil, sugar and all but 2 tbsp of the yogurt. Coat the fish with this mixture and set aside for atleast 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Cut the cucumber lengthwise (bâtonnet) and toss in the reserved yogurt, chopped mint and the lime juice. You want to be modest with the lime juice. Too much acidity can mask the taste of the fish.</p>
<p>Sear the fillets on an overproof pan--setting aside the excess marinade--for about 1.5 minutes on each side or until golden brown. If don't have an overproof pan, just use any skillet and a pre-heated baking pan.</p>
<p>Spoon over the marinade and place the pan in the oven and cook until done (the insides of the fish turns white and is flaky to cut). Transfer to a warm plate and serve with the cuccumber.</p>
<p> Now, wasn't that simple. Ramsey's a genius in creating simple foods.</p>
