<p>Well, this is a first post to my blog using Jott, which is a very cool service.  It allows you to call a number and talk what you want to post, and post it to your blog.  I think it's one of the new tools that really enable blogging.  I'm just going to try it and see how it works out. <a href="http://www.jott.com/show.aspx?id=d6549201-5361-44c4-adf3-ef43abf8488c" target="_blank">listen</a></p>
