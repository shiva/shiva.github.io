<p>Several people are shocked to hear that I read 1000+ emails and <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/shared/18301612726860782682">several hundred blog posts a day</a>. Ofcourse, when I say that, all I mean is that, I process that much content. I read around 30-40% (That is really the signal-to-noise ratio of web content these days--and that is, if you are subscribed to high quality feeds)</p>
<p> </p>

<p>One of friends was curious how I can handle all that data flow, and I emailed her this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Everyday, go to bed with a zero count.</li>
<li>Use tools to reduce your processing. (use email rules/filters to move mails to manageable folders and Google reader for feeds)</li>
<li>Learn to skip-read. I use a 2 parse method.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Parse through sets of items (email headers or blog post headlines), and mark the ones your need to pay attention to (usually around 40%). </li>
<li>Filter based on short-listed items and then go through them in detail. In the case of blog posts, if something does retain my attention after the first 4 sentences, I skip that item.</li>
<li>(only for blog posts) I mark the ones I have to comment on, and then do my commenting after I finish a folder.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes, you just can't squeeze everything in a day, I either bookmark or mail it to myself to be addressed over the weekend.</li>
</ul>
<p>What do you think? Am I missing something that will make my life a little easier?</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Thanks to Aswinanand for pointing this out--I don't really get 1000+ emails. I was just exaggerating (which is just another way of saying, click-baiting! :) )</p>
