<p>Created a common blog site for my wife and me to blog on..<br />
<br />This blogging thingy is amazing.... it really let's people open up and be much more communicative and open minded with the rest of the world.</p>
<p>let us see how she piks up blogging.. I think it should create some interesting dialogues between the two of us...</p>
<p>and yeah... you should get your wife and/or girlfriend (;) .. don't let one know abt the other) to blog with you ... is an interesting way of getting together on some activity and is not bound by time and location...</p>
<p>remember when your dad left notes for your mom on the refridgerator ...I think it is the modern fridge note!!! ;)<br />
