<p>Check it out!!! I love thee Google, "Lord of Search"!!<br />
<br />Really really neat way to access information. Very quick, a little scary considering that Google can go on to become the next MS! We the users of technology (particularly developers, testers etc) are going to have more exiciting times!!</p>
<p>Google Desktop is a like have the Google search engine installed for searching your system. it indexes your system, and ofcourse it currently supports only Microsoft products, but hope that a few of the open source software liek thunderbird and firefox are also supported soon.</p>
<p>Looking for that file that you know is about something , but just can't remember where you put it on your system.. no probs, just load up a browser with GDesktop and it'll find it for you!
