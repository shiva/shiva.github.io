<p>Lomography - a new meaning to "shooting from the hip"! Something that I would love to try one of these days... and I'm offering an opportunity to my readers !! if there are any? Shoot any image, conditions</p>
<p>1. do not look through the viewfinder<br />
<br />2. shoot from hip-level<br />
<br />3. give a intro note to your image<br />
<br />4. send it to me (mail - jpg, cd/floppy - bmp)</p>
<p>mail me for my address : shvelmur@gmail.com</p>
<p>I will host the best of the lot at my site!<br />
<br />http://www.employees.org/~shvelmur/index.html</p>
<p>and write a blog about how great a lomographer you are!!<br />
