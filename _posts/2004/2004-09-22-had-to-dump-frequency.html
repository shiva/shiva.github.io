<p>Had to dump Frequency! :( No support for titles! Based on the old Blogger 1.0 API and free only for 15 days!!. Desperately in need of another client based interface, after moving to opera. It is such a pain, to browse in one environment and having to open IR just for blogging.</p>
<p>I think I should write a client myself based on the atom API. Now that I have a VC environment with me, I might just do that! If at anyone reads this blog, please do get in touch with me if you are interested in write a small VC++ application that will sit on the taskbar, and will let you post to blogger.</p>
<p>Btw, I found a really kewl photo site<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.photo.net">photo.net</a></p>
<p>A very nice quote on the website -<br />
