<p>This is a very kewl gui toolkit for J2se, .NET, J2me .<br />
<br />Very neat and neat indeed.</p>
<p>Zaval Light-Weght - Visual Component Library</p>
<p>It is available under GPL and comercial license.. Need to try using it with a coupla tools I have in mind. I know that there are zillions of open-source utilities out there, but I am looking for ideas for applications and utilities that you would liket o use at home/work.</p>
<p>Any suggestions are welcome. I develop using the following</p>
<p>1. J2SE<br />
<br />2. J2EE<br />
<br />3. .NET<br />
<br />4. VC++<br />
<br />5. eVC++ (pocket pc)<br />
<br />6. J2ME<br />
<br />7. Perl/CGI</p>
<p>So if you are here, by doing a google search then do send me requests for tools that you would like to use and let me have a go at them. Who knows? we could be thinking of the next netscape!? ;)
