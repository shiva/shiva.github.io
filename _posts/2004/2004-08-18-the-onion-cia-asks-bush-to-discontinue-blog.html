<p>Come on old man! Get your grips on. You go on to tell the entire world that you have to attend a secret meeting?! Duh?! That kind of beats the purpose of a secret meeting uh?!</p>
<p>Well, one has to appreciate the efforts of a president, if he thinks that he wants to tell his unedited opinion about things to the people of the world. That is worth applause. It is not that I concur with all his opinions, but if we had a leader or two, who would pick up blogging and will read through the comments that the people give to his opinions, India can become a far better place?!</p>
<p>Don't you think so?</p>
