<p>I have been meaning to get into the exciting world of static site-gen. Why, you ask? Well, I will tell you why?! Actually, I'm too lazy, and it's late on a Sunday night -- instead, <a href="http://mickgardner.com/">Mick Gardner</a>, can inform you on the <a href="http://mickgardner.com/2011/04/27/An-Introduction-To-Static-Site-Generators.html">virtues of static site-generation</a>.</p>
<p>After an hour of mucking around with several site-generators, I chose <a href="http://stasis.me/">Stasis</a>, which is a good compromise to the blog-oriented <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, and options-insanity that is <a href="http://nanoc.stoneship.org/">nanoc</a>. With my new-found fascination for Ruby, I wanted to stay away from <a href="http://ringce.com/hyde">Hyde</a> (which is Python based -- it's time to try the dark-side, a little)</p>
<p><a href="http://haml.info/">HAML</a>, is an interesting markup language. Although it cleanups some of the clutter of html, there are still things that are annoying. For example:</p>
<p>HTML:<br />
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/2760742.js?file=sample.html"></script></p>
<p>HAML:<br />
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/2760742.js?file=sample.haml"></script></p>
<p>Although, the HTML version has intrusive tags, it is easier on the eyes. It is a relief, not have to code, the end tag for every HTML element. It is much faster to type HAML by hand (especially in vim). In the end, it was a quick, painless process to convert the raw HTML code, to HAML, and generate the same html using stasis.</p>
<p>Life's good. I'm still learning a few new tricks. What more can one ask for?</p>
