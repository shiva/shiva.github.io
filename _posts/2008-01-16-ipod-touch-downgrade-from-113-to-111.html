<p>My ipod touch was upgraded to 1.1.3, after connecting to my computer, and I wanted to downgrade to 1.1.1, so I could jailbreak it and put any app I want on it.</p>
<p><a href="http://ipodtouchmaster.com/">ipodtouchmaster </a>found <a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/YakjwxB3nQU">a way to downgrade</a> it using iPhuc.</p>
