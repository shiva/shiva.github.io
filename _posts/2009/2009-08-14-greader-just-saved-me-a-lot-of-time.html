<p>Google reader is one of Google&#39;s products, that didn&#39;t you didn&#39;t realize you needed until you started using it. Heck, pretty much every product they do is in that category. It is one app where I <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/shared/shvelmur">spend a lot of time every day</a>. That is how I still manage to read blogs. Even after <a href="http://twitter.com/shiva">twitter </a>and <a href="http://facebook.com/shivanand">facebook </a>and <a href="http://friendfeed.com/shivanand">friendfeed</a>, GReader is still the place, where you can truly control the signal vs noise ratio of content that you read. </p>

<div>Today, they have turned on a little feature that I have long pained for. It&#39;s a little tweak, but a huge convenience. I tend to spend a few days away from reader once in a while, and when I come back, it&#39;s a pain to filter out the content you want to read when you have 1000+ items. This little feature let&#39;s me choose, which feeds I can ignore completely, which one, I need to read only the last week&#39;s worth, etc...</div>
<p>
<div>Thank you Google, for doing the right thing.</div>
