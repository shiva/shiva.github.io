<p><em>Update: Apparently, I had accidentally hit a minor bug in pew. This has now been <a href="https://github.com/berdario/invewrapper/issues/21">fixed</a>.</em></p>
<p>Every so often, we spend several hours battling an issue, fighting linux or python or people or thoughts. The solution, often, leaps out when there has been a respite in the constant search for the solution. It's the "duh" moment, that all of us feel. There is a little self-loathing, and relief at having arrived at solution. It is a moment of great pleasure, that I have learned to relish.</p>
<p>I am currently on a bit of <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a> binge, and I was setting up a dev environment, using <a href="http://crunchbang.org/">Crunchbang</a> on <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">Virtualbox</a>. Since it is a clean install, I wanted to bootstrap using only <a href="https://github.com/berdario/invewrapper">pew</a> and <a href="http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/">pip</a>, which have recently become my favourite part of working in a pure python environment (no more sudo == yay!!)</p>
<p>I followed the <a href="https://github.com/berdario/invewrapper#installation">instructions to install pew</a> (which is quite straight-forward). All one should need is</p>
<pre><code>pip install pew
</code></pre>
<p>However, when I tried the same, the install worked, but I couldn't run pew. It couldn't find all the libraries it needed to load (virtualenv, in this case)</p>
<pre><code>shiva@crunchbang-2:~$ sudo pip install pew

shiva@crunchbang-2:~$ pew ls

</code></pre>
<p>After trying several things, including looking a lot of code in pew, the fix was quite simple.</p>
<p>The version of setup-tools that comes default with python2.7 and crunchbang seems flawed.</p>
<pre><code>shiva@crunchbang-2:~$ sudo pip install -U setuptools
