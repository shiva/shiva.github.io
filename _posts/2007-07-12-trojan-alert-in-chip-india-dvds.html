<p>I use AVG antivirus, which has never ever caught a virus on my laptop. For long, I have pondered if I really need one, since I have been quite fastidious in&nbsp; ensuring the media that I download/execute on my laptop. In my eagerness to try out Dreamweaver CS3 and Photoshop CS3, I slipped in the latest chip-India&nbsp;&nbsp; DVD (July 07) which carries the trialwares, and boom! AVG chucked out its first trojan alert in the last 5 years! That is quite amazing ain't it? I haven't had a virus in half a decade and boom one fine day!!!<a href="http://www.zooomr.com/photos/45074@Z01/2679721/" atomicselection="true"><img style="margin: 5px 0px 0px" src="/images/2679721_707625f9c0_o.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>There goes my&nbsp;dream of working on windows without security software taking 50% of my computing resources. Oh, by the way, can someone from CHIP tell me if I get anything coz I found a&nbsp;trojan in your discs?!</p>
