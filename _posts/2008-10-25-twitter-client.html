<p>I got really sick of using Adobe AIR apps that take up more and more of system memory for an app that does twitter.</p>
<p>I've decided to put my "coding for myself" hat on and write a QT based C++ application (that should be cross-platform). No name as yet, but I will find something soon. QtTwitter is taken. Mebbe, once I have a working version, I can get ownership of the project on google code.</p>

<p>That's the proposed GUI. Sorry for the bad light. The iphone cam's not too good with tungsten light.</p>
<p>Any suggestions?! I will try and post some mock up as I create em. I don't want to be writing my own twitter REST c++ library. Any suggestion are welcome.</p>
