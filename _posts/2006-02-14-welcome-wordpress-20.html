<p>I have been away far too long this time around. But, I finally find some time to do my bloggy thingy!</p>
<p>I managed to finally migrate to Wordpress 2.0 with the latest K2 theme. (btw great work with the theme guys)</p>
<p>It has been a very hectic month, and very busy and interesting start to the year! Some of the stuff I have been dabbling in since the begining of this year</p>
<p>- a framework for implementing a control plane in a java application (see JCtrlPlane)<br />
- attended the Sun Tech Days conference at Chennai on 7th, 8th and 9th of February (more on that below)<br />
- a kewl Java Jacket<br />
- lots of architectural work, at work<br />
- thinking about where my life is going<br />
- The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy<br />
- Catching up on old friends<br />
- Finally... started working out (my abs that is ;) )</p>
