<p>The simple way to retreive the list of changed files would be to update the tree, which would then list the files updated.</p>
<p><code>#cvs update . &gt; filelist.dat</code></p>
<p>The problem with this, is that if there have been changes to other files after your last update, you will have to manually glean the files that you have changed. I tend face this, particularly during the last couple of weeks before a release, since you don't want to risk updating your tree everyday, but still have to make 2/3 checkins. I did some googling today, and found how to find the list of files changed without updating your tree.</p>
<p><code>#cvs -n update . &gt; filelist.dat</code></p>
<p>Thanks <a href="http://blog.jonnay.net/archives/181-Getting-a-list-of-changed-files-in-CVS-without-updating.html">Jonnay</a> for this. I should used man before I googled, but hey, I'm lazy today :)</p>
