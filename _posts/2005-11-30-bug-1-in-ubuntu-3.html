<p>I found a very interesting bug report on ubuntu! If you haven't heard about Ubuntu, then this bug report is definetely a must read. Check it out! </p>
<blockquote cite="https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+bug/1"><p>Microsoft has a majority market share in the new desktop PC marketplace. This is a bug, which Ubuntu is designed to fix.</p></blockquote>
<p class="citation"><cite cite="https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+bug/1"><a href="https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+bug/1">Bug #1 in Ubuntu - Microsoft has a majority market share</a></cite></p>
<p>I tried to see how the latest release of Ubuntu has addressed this particular bug, and I see that it is still pending. Although, the open-source OS guys are striving a lot for features, but somehow everyone has forgotten the root-cause that made unix so popular. </p>
<p>Both System V and BSD version allowed the user to quick execute a set of jobs, allowed users to stitch small applications to make bigger equivalents of them. I see that no one is trying to challenge the notion of UI that Windows introduced back in the last century! A lot of that is happening on the web, but we need that kind of radical rethinking of UI, if you want to kick Microsoft's share down!<br /><!-- technorati tags begin -->
