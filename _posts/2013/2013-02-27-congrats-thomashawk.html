<p>Congrats to Thomashawk on the <a href="http://blog.flickr.net/2013/02/22/thomas-hawk-im-trying-to-capture-1-million-photos-before-i-die/">flickr interview</a>!</p>
<p>"Why? Who?", you ask. <a href="http://thomashawk.com">Thomashawk</a>, photographer extraordinaire, has taught me a lot about photography. I've never met him, or gone on a photo-walk (to be fixed some day), but have learnt from his work, nonetheless.</p>
<p>I am compelled to write this, because, in some ways, there is a certain vindication to Flickr doing an article on him. He has been Flickr's ardent fan, and critic. It's been a long road! From the fun insanity of DMU(s), Zooomr, and flickr censorship to getting some well reserved recognition. Kudos!</p>
