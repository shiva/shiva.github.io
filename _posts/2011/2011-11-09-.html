<p>1. Assuming an <a href="http://wiki.answers.com/Q/How_much_does_an_average_car_weigh">average car weighs around 4000 pounds</a></p>
<p>2. Force required to move such a car (neglecting friction):</p>
<p><code>F = ma</code></p>
<p>As per the above,<br />
<code><br />
m = 4000 /2.2 kg [approx. 1800 kg]<br />
a = 1 m/sec^2</code></p>
<p>=&gt; F = 1800 N</p>
<p>3. Since it would be next to impossible to get a rare earth magnet that produced that kind of force, we would be, better served trying to use a solenoid. The formula to get the force generated by a <a href="http://www.daycounter.com/Calculators/Magnets/Solenoid-Force-Calculator.phtml">solenoid is given by</a>:</p>
<p>F = ((N * I) ^ 2 * k * A) / 2 * g ^ 2</p>
<p>Where,</p>
<p>N - No of turns</p>
<p>I - Current in Amps</p>
<p>k = 4 * pi * 10 ^ -7 (constant)</p>
<p>A - Cross-section of the solenoid</p>
<p>g - distance between solenoid and the metal that needs to be attracted</p>
<p>From the above, assuming a cross section of 0.5 sq m (A), current of 10 A (I), and a distance of 1 m from the solenoid (g), the number of turns required to produce 1 m/sec^2 acceleration on a 1800 Kg car is,</p>
<p>N ~= 7.568 * 10 ^ 3 ~= 7000 turns</p>
<p>Now, Density of Copper isÂ <strong><span style="color: #af0000;">8.92 gm/cm</span><sup><span style="color: #af0000;">3. We can guesstimate the weight by guesing the lenght of such a solenoid.</span></sup></strong></p>
