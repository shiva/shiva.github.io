<p>This is a test post from <a title="" href="http://blogsyapp.com/" target="_self">blogsy</a>, an iPad blogging tool.</p>
<p>The interface design looks thoughtful -- drag &amp; drop of images from flickr and picasa, videos from YouTube, a built it google search and browser to get at other content. Although there is a bit of a learning curve, it makes the iPad a true content generation device.</p>
<p>Maybe this will keep me blogging this time around.Â On that note, here's a cutie pie to bring a smile to you, today.</p>
