<p>When in doubt, take a poet's thought to your heart. They are, invariably experienced beings, that have spent a great deal of their lives, exploring the heart through the mind.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Strong Mercy by Rabindranath Tagore</strong></p>
<p>My desires are many and my cry is pitiful,<br />
but ever didst thou save me by hard refusals;<br />
and this strong mercy has been wrought into my life through and through. </p>
<p>Day by day thou art making me worthy of the simple,<br />
great gifts that thou gavest to me unasked—this sky and the light, this body and the<br />
life and the mind—saving me from perils of overmuch desire.</p>
<p>There are times when I languidly linger<br />
and times when I awaken and hurry in search of my goal;<br />
but cruelly thou hidest thyself from before me. </p>
<p>Day by day thou art making me worthy of thy full acceptance by<br />
refusing me ever and anon, saving me from perils of weak, uncertain desire.</p></blockquote>
<p>This poem, expresses a lot of what's on my mind, at this ungodly hour (its 3:39 am), except for the last couple of lines. I didn't want to editorialize a poem, and hence left it in place.</p>
