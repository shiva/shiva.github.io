<p>If you are in a hurry, and need something tasty yet easy to make, this one is for you. The prep time is about 5 minutes, and the cooking time around 10-15 minutes. If you have a small rice cooker -- the kind that plugs into a wall sockets -- you should be able to get the rice done in about the same time.</p>
<p>It is also the perfect curry to cook for smaller portions. If you are like me, and have to cook for 1 person, aka me, Â all the time, it is a no-frills and no-freezer required recipe.</p>
<p>1. Fry all the onions until soft (5-6 mins) in high heat<br />
2. add mined garlic, 1 tsp jeera, 1 tsp dania powder, and salt to taste, some tumeric powder (1 tsp for each handful of prawns), and chilli powder to taste (I use very little)<br />
3. add some salt (increases the temp and allows everything to sear nicely)<br />
4. cook for 4 mins or until the prawns are half-cooked<br />
5. add diced tomatoes, and salt to taste (remember to taste the sauce before adding the salt)<br />
6. sear for 1 min and then add 1/2 cup of water (not too much or you will over cook the prawns), and reduce heat, and simmer until the above consistency is reached.</p>
<p>cook some rice, and you have a decent meal!</p>
