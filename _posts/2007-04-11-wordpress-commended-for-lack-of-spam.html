<p>Me and thousands of other people, continue to use wordpress, one of the leading blog management systems (sounds kewl, eh? ;) ), and proof that is it in fact leading is <a href="http://www.plagiarismtoday.com/2007/04/09/why-wordpresscom-is-virtually-spam-free/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Apparently, <a href="http://wordpress.com" target="_blank">Wordpress.com</a>, has the least spam, compared to other free blog-hosting services. The honored list of competitors, include the likes of google, myspace and AOL, each one of them goliaths! <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Mullenweg" target="_blank">Matt Mullenweg</a>, the creator of <a href="http://wordpress.org" target="_blank">Wordpress</a>, associates the success of wordpress.com spam protection to Akismet. This is something that I use now. I used spam-karma before this, which was pretty good, but with Akismet, it is almost zero-management.</p>
<p>Google, with its wonderful, spam filter on gmail, should be able to do much better, but then, comment spam is a very different ball game.</p>
