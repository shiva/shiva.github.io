<p>After what has been ages, I have returned. Not that many are reading this, but I intend to use this for future reference in any case</p>
<p>I have wanted to learn javascript, and this time I found a sustainable way. Learn a language by implementing something very huge in it. I'm writing, what I must say a very kewl application at work, and am learning quite a few tricks in javascript.</p>
<p><strong>1. Associative arrays in javascript:</strong><br />
Although, the Array() datatype, looks like a juicy candidate for building associative arrays, that is one of the most harmful things you can do. Particularly if you are using the prototype library. For more information read this <a href="http://www.andrewdupont.net/2006/05/18/javascript-associative-arrays-considered-harmful/">post </a></p>
<p>The solution: use the Object datatype<br />
<strong>2. How to iterate an Object in javascript:<br />
</strong>        There are a couple of really kewl ways to iterate objects:<br />
1. for .. in<br />
2. for each .. in</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Guide:Object_Manipulation_Statements">object manipulation guide</a></p>
<p>Will add more as I go along.</p>
<p>Btw, JSON rules - the following links on list libraries that aid in creating JSON based AJAXified applications.<br />
<a href="http://www.json.org/js.html">1. JSON in javascript (client-side stuff)</a><br />
<a href="http://json-lib.sourceforge.net/index.html">2. JSON in Java (server-side stuff)</a></p>
