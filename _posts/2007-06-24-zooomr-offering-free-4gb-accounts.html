<p><a href="http://zooomr.com">Zooomr</a>, for those of you, who don't know it, is a photo-sharing site, that is developed and maintained by a single developer, <a href="http://beta.zooomr.com/photos/kristopher/">Kristopher</a> <a href="http://www.netmag.co.uk/zine/discover-interview/kistopher-tate">Tate</a>. Thomas Hawk, the CEO, is a wonderful photographer, and writes a great blog, which you should check out.</p>
<p>If Flickr started web2.0 photo-sharing, zooomr is slowly moving the game forward. The latest version of zooomr, offers a bunch of new features, that are nothing short of amazing. Now, they are offering <a href="http://blog.zooomr.com/2006/07/20/more-love-for-bloggers-25gb-free-pro-accounts/">free pro-accounts for bloggers </a>who use zooomr. (Marketing tip #1: Befriend the blogger). Ohh, btw, you can choose to use zooomr, on any blog service that allows you to add html to your post. I guess, that includes every single blog service out there!</p>
