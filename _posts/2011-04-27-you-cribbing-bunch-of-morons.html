<p>And now you've done it!! Bah! I thought it was so cool that I could plot of heat map of my location for a full year. With <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2011/04/iphone-customers-lawsuit-data/">all</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://gigaom.com/2011/04/21/researcher-iphone-location-data-already-used-by-cops/">the</a> <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2011/04/iphone-location/">cribbing</a> around the internets about how the iphone is not secure because it stores data (ie a cache of your location data), Apple has decided to squash this wonderful "easter egg".&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>Sometime in the next few weeks Apple will release a free iOS software update that:</p>
<p>reduces the size of the crowd-sourced Wi-Fi hotspot and cell tower database cached on the iPhone,<br />
ceases backing up this cache, and<br />
deletes this cache entirely when Location Services is turned off.<br />
In the next major iOS software release the cache will also be encrypted on the iPhone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wouldn't it be cool, if someone actually wrote an app that does the exact same thing? I bet it would sell like crazy! I'd buy it.</p>
