<p><span style="font-family:verdana;">This blogging thingy is turning out to be good. It let's you interface with people and take a sneak peek into their minds, (which btw, I think has been the most characteristic search of humankind in the last century - a peek into the evolving human mind) without tramping on their time or egos!</p>
<p>anyway, on my wayward browsing adventure, I happened to look at a quote posted on one of the blogs by </span><a href="http://rainy.net/"><span style="font-family:verdana;">Heather</span></a><span style="font-family:verdana;"></p>
<p>"I'd say I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I'm not. I excel at not giving a shit. Experience has taught me that interest begets expectation, and expectation beget disappointment, so the key to avoiding disappointment is to avoid interest. A equals B equals C Equals A, or whatever. I also don't have a lot of interest in being a good person or a bad person. From what I can tell, either way, you're screwed. Bad people are punished by society's laws, and good people are punished by Murphy's Law. So you see my dilemma." - Georgia Lass" - <strong>Dead Like Me </strong></p>
<p>Now, how true is that. How many times, have we thought that everytime that we do something real good, we get screwed up for it, and the smallest of demeanors that we are put under the microscope! - well that's life for you!!</p>
<p>and Heather - that you quote, probably echoes the sentiments of most of us in the last two and half decades, with world we live in turning more and more cynical by the day!</span><br />
