<p>Well, finally managed to catch the moview! The moview has been banned all over Tamil Nadu (Drat!!!), but I chanced to catch it. IPrehaps because I have read the book, the actors seem to be mere narrators of the script. I could hardly accept Tom Hanks (guess he is getting a little old these days), as Robert Langdon. I like Silas though, but would have expected a more burly man!</p>
<p>Aringarosa, fails to convey the passion that he felt for christianity!! But nevertheless, the movie is a must watch, atleast for you to realise, you are better off reading a book, than watching it!</p>
