<p>The reason for the respite in my blogging, was my move to a new web-host. After several hours of researching, I decided to go with <a href="http://www.webfaction.com/?affiliate=shvelmur">webfaction.com</a>. If you haven't already visited webfaction, <a href="http://www.webfaction.com/?affiliate=shvelmur">DO IT right now</a>! It has been simply amazing. I love the one click installer, and within hours of getting billed, I got access to my account. It comes with shell access, SFTP, enough space, <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">rails 2.x</a> (just days after it was release), <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">django</a>, <a href="http://wordpress.org/download/">wordpress 2.3.1</a> and a host of other webapps, all of which you can install with a just a few clicks on their web interface.</p>
<p><em>Note: links provided to webfaction's website, have my <a href="http://www.webfaction.com/?affiliate=shvelmur">affiliate link</a>.Â Â </em></p>
