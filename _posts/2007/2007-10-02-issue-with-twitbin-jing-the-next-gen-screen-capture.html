<p><a href="http://www.twitbin.com/">Twitbin</a> has been my favourite client for twitter. the key thing that attracted me to it, was that I can use twitter, along side my browsing, and that makes life much simpler. Also, it have a very simple interface, to track your friends and their messages.</p>

<p>I realized how much it mean to my twittering experience, when it went down sometime last week. I presumed, it was due to the upgrades that the twitter team was planning, and want to see if the problem persists. Well, looks like twitter is working fine now, through the web-interface, and I guess twitbin should be operational now, but.. well NO.. I still have to use the web interface and it suck big time.</p>
<p>Just click on the image, on the side, to see a screencast of how I try to use twit-bin and the errors.</p>
<p>that brings us to the next very cool tool I have been using. It's called <a href="http://www.jingproject.com/">Jing</a>, and it does screen captures. If you are a screen capture addict like myself, you need this tool. Another very neat thing with this tool, is that it allows you to capture only a small portion of the screen (you can select it), and do, either an image capture or a screencast recording on that selected area. Very nice for showing your users, how to use your software or to help your mom do something.</p>
<p>They also provide a <a href="http://www.screencast.com/">service, where you can host your screencast</a>, and it is free for 200MB storage and 1 GB bandwidth.</p>
