<p>I wonder what's happening to me. This is the third post in the last one hour. I must be going crazy. Anyway, this must the least used blog on earth, so what the heck. (I know there are a few of you out there, but you don't say much on my blog!! :( )</p>
<p>Before I bore you into leaving this page, here's what this post is about:</p>
<p><strong>Have you seen this somewhere?</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://shvelmur.com/images/wpress/ThatswhatIcallasearch_2C7/wear01_autumn07021.jpg" atomicselection="true"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="240" src="/images/wear01_autumn0702.jpg" width="160" border="0" /></a> </p>
<p>(Ohh.. for those who can't place that photo, isn't that a wallpaper that comes with Windows XP?!)</p>
<p>Nick Toshces, asked himself that, and didn't stop at that. He went about asking half the world. He bullied Microsoft, Bill Gates, a few of his friends and the photographer himself. So where is this place? Find out <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/ontheweb/features/2007/02/autumn200702?printable=true&curren;tPage=all" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>This is one problem that you wouldn't face with Windows Vista. Check out <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/01/25/1529570.aspx" target="_blank">this</a> and <a href="http://www.istartedsomething.com/20070126/finding-vista-wallpapers/" target="_blank">this</a>.</p>
<p>Jason Kottke, put me onto this. Thanks to you, Jason, for a wonderful feed. You are my <a href="http://kottke.org" target="_blank">link</a> to the world (pun intented).</p>
<p>Btw, if you find it difficult (lazy/bored), to load up my website, please use a feedreader. There are several out <a href="http://www.google.co.in/search?q=feed+readers&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a" target="_blank">there</a>. I use <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/view/" target="_blank">Google reader</a>, which is probably google's best app till date, apart from search and gmail. You can read it from anywhere, including my new <a href="http://shvelmur.com/wpress/2007/02/15/new-phone-nokia-n73/" target="_blank">Nokia N73</a>, which I think is a pretty amazing feature. (I can't share from my mobile - such a drab)</p>
