<p>Trying to get the Sony Ericsson W800i has been by far the most traumatic experience of my life. I tried everything possible, but still was unable to get it recognised on my home PC!</p>
<p>So, finally I decided to resort to the most reliable way to get anything to work with a PC. Do a google search!!!</p>
<p>Found a wonderful link, (on a forum that solved the issue). Here is the fix suggested, (I have organised in to be more of a step-by-step guide.</p>
<p>The following involves tampering with the Windows Registry. Kindly take a BACKUP of your registry using regedit before attempting any changes. Oh yeah.. you are on your own in case you screw up something.</p>
<p>EXPORT ALL THE KEYS MENTIONED BELOW BEFORE DELETING THEM! ALWAYS BEST TO HAVE A BACKUP</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure your phone is NOT connected to your computer.</li>
<li>Run Regedit.</li>
<li>Browse to "My ComputerHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESYSTEMCurrentControlSetEnumUSB"</li>
<li>Delete all key that start with "Vis_0fce&amp;Pid_d028".</li>
<li>You should be back to a stage where no w800 is installed on your machine.</li>
<li>Download the drivers (Approved ones) from SE's website under Support.</li>
<li>Run the EXE file and let it install.</li>
<li>Connect your phone through the USB cable.</li>
</ul>
