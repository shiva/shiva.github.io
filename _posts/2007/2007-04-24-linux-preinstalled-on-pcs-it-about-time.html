<p>And the timing is perfect. Mr Dell, as it turns out (a little Douglassy, eh? Don't get it, read "Salmon of Doubt", the last book by Douglas Adams, pg 27), runs Ubuntu, Feisty Fawn on his <a href="http://www.dell.com/content/topics/global.aspx/corp/biographies/en/msd_computers">home PC</a>. Well, one of his PCs, he has four mamoths with 4GB RAM and a Quadro FX 3500 et al, costing well over $4000. Aparently, he also runs windows as well. Hmmm... living the high life.</p>
<p>Need to restain myself from owning more computing equipment.. grrrr..</p>
