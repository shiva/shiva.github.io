<p>I recently quit my job at Novell. After more than half a decade of working 5 days a week and several hours a day, I get to spend my time doing only things I want to do. No more tasks that I have to complete, no more deadlines, no more betas to release (atleast for a few more weeks). I get some time to myself before take a deep dive into the job of chucking out code day-in and day-out.</p>
<p>Here are some thing that I thoroughly enjoyed doing in the first week&nbsp;:</p>
<ol>
<li>Started learning RoR.</li>
<li>Check my email and respond!</li>
<li>Read all my feeds&nbsp;the first thing in the morning.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Install all required software on my laptop.</li>
<li><a href="http://beta.zooomr.com/photos/45074@Z01/">Uploaded some pictures</a> on <a href="http://beta.zooomr.com/">zooomr</a>. (yeah they are up and stable now)</li>
</ol>
<p>I have started work on a small project in rails, which I shall announce once I have a working prototype.</p>
