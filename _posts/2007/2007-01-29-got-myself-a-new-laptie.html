<p>I'm now officially one of the self-obssessed techie guys, sitting in public places and completely ignoring all the life-forms around me. Got a very nice deal from HP. Here is the config!</p>
<p><a href="http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/in/en/ho/WF06b/1090709-1116637-1116665-1116665-1116665-12724286-78159183.html?jumpid=oc_R1002_INENC-001_HP%20Pavilion%20dv2124tu%20Notebook%20PCâŒ©=en&cc=in"><strong>HP Pavillion DV2124TU</strong></a><br />
Intel Pentium Core Duo 1.6 Ghz<br />
1 GB (2 X 512 MB) DDR2 SDRAM<br />
Intel 945 800Mhz FSB Motheboard<br />
14.1" Widescreen Display<br />
LightScribe DVD-RW drive<br />
802.11 a/b/g wireless<br />
Bluetooth<br />
Infrared<br />
Altec Lansing Speakers<br />
Built in modem and ethernet ports<br />
3 USB ports<br />
1 DV based USB<br />
SD/MMC-Pro/MS/XD card reader<br />
Remote control for DVD player<br />
Windows XP Media Center Edition</p>
<p>It costs around Rs. 56000 in India. Since I bought the laptop before the 31 jan 2007, I get the following freebies</p>
<p>Hauppage USB TV tuner card<br />
Reliance USB Internet Data card</p>
<p>This is essentially the dv2000 branded as 2124 in India. oh yeah, since I bought it betwwen Nov 06 and Mar 07, I get a free upgrade to Windows Vista when it is released.</p>
<p>It took me the whole of the weekend to get it into working shape, installing all the necessary open source tools that I use. Still a lot of work ahead. I hope to blog more since I have access to decent computing power where ever I go.</p>
