<p>After several months of keeping away from updating or changing my website, I broke the fast today. I found a wonderful plugin, <a href="http://www.underjc.com/?q=node/13">sideRSS</a>, which allows display of RSS feeds within a blog's sidebar. As usual, I needed a specific functionality that was not supported the way I wanted it. I hacked it a little bit, renamed the plugin, and posted a custom version for download on my website.</p>
<p>If you need to share Google Shared Items, on your blog, but hate to include javascript (like I do), then use this. You can download it <a href="http://shvelmur.com/downloads/projects/ex-siderss.php">here</a> (right-click and use "Save Target As...") and find install information <a href="http://shvelmur.com/wpress/projects/exsiderss/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Also, if you like this version, and would like me to add a few more features (I have some in mind though, like ATOM parsing), do suggest them in the comments section.</p>
<p>P.S: If you are <a href="http://www.underjc.com/">Chris Hatcher</a>, the author of the original <a href="http://www.underjc.com/?q=node/13">SideRSS</a>, and want to take this version down or something, just leave a message here - you will need to merge my changes in your code though :-)</p>
