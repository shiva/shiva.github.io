"Someone's been eating my porridge and they ate it all up!" cried the Baby bear.<br />

<p>After a long ride from Bangalore, whilst I was sleeping blissfully, some rascal, ran through our house, ate an apple, stole a couple of jars of Pickle (good ones at that), helped himself to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>My Philips DVD player (it was skipping at most DVDs anyway)</li>
<li>An old Sony Tape recorder/player (apparently, some was wrong with it, and needed replacement)</li>
<li>1 apple (worth Rs 25, but actually priceless since my wife got it for me)</li>
<li style="text-decoration: line-through">2 bottles of mushroom pickle</li>
<li>1 bottle of mushroom, and 1 bottle of (the famous) panchranga pickle (five types of fruit and vegetables)</li>
</ul>
<p>Ohh.. also he chased my cats out.</p>
<p>Well, looks as if nothing else is missing. Only the hollow feeling that someone invaded my den when I was sleeping. That kinda robs the secure feeling that one feels, when one is at home!</p>
<p>Whoever you are, you better not get caught, coz I really loved those bottles of pickle! (They were from Punjab - you see) :)</p>
<p>Update: Apparently, he flicked a pack of cigarettes also!! (He's even helping me quit smoking!!). Also a bottle of after-shave that my wife bought for me!</p>
