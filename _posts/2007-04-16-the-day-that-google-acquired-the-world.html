<p>&nbsp;Philipp Lenssen, has an interesting (scary) thought about the day that <a href="http://blog.outer-court.com/archive/2007-04-14-n32.html">google acquired the world (aka internet :) ).</a> The date that he has chosen, 12 May 2017, sent a shiver up my spine. I, definitely, don't want to see the world taken over by the most efficient search engine on my birthday!! :) That would be some scary stuff to wake up too.</p>
<p>Since we are on the subject of acquisitions, <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?q=google+doubleclick&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a">google paid over $3 billion for doubleclick</a>, a company that <a href="http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2007/04/why-theres-no-doubleclick-ad-on.html">google didn't beleive in</a> when it wanted to serve ads in the first place. How ironic! You pay more than what you invested in your company, to acquire something you didn't believe in! I find that a little absurd, and you?</p>
