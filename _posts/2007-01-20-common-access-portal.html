<p>With advent of web 2.0, and some habits cultivated over the last decade, I have a certain list of tasks that I do everyday. I current visit a bunch of websites more than once a day, and an integrated interface would do me so much good.</p>
<p>- mail, a whole set of accounts, gmail, yahoo, etc<br />
- feed readers<br />
- blog editor<br />
- orkut<br />
- del.icio<br />
- google notebook</p>
<p>What is lacking, is the ability to have a single sign-on/account mgmt capability, a common dashboard, ability to cross-launch/cross-post content.</p>
<p>Ohh yeah, I want to do thiss all from either my desktop or from my own hosted page.</p>
<p>So there are some deep implicating requirements for my latest craze - get more done with less clicks!</p>
<p>I christen it Common Access Portal (Let's put a CAP on things we use!)</p>
<p>[tags]tools, design, wordpress plugins, development, ideas[/tags]</p>
