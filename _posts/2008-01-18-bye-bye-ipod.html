<p>Since <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2008/01/15touch.html">I don't enjoyed being screwed over when I buy a $500 product</a>, I said buh-bye to my ipod touch today. One thing that I enjoyed, was the sharpness of the display. I will definetly buy this device again, if I knew for sure that, Apple will not pull another stunt like that with the <a href="http://www.downloadsquad.com/2007/10/17/iphone-and-ipod-touch-sdk-coming-in-february/">imminent</a> <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2007/10/17/apple-we-plan-to-have-an-iphone-sdk-in-developers-hands-in-fe/">release </a>of IPOD touch SDK. So until then, I commute for 2 hours everyday with no music to listen, no podcast from CNN to watch :(</p>
