<p>I use git -- quite extensively. At work, we have several git repositories, across different organizations. In addition, I also <a href="http://github.com/shiva">hack</a> for pleasure. Interacting with several git servers means that I need to have different roles and identities for them. The solution is to setup up one ssh key for each domain, and use ~/.ssh/config profiles to control them. Based on the host I'm connecting to, a different ssh private/public key pair is used -- make life a lot easier!</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.karan.org/index.php/2009/08/25/multiple-ssh-private-keys">Karanbir Singh</a>, for this:</p>
