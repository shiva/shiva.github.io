<p>This saturday, I will be leaving to Sweden for work. It will be an exciting two months! Hopefully, I will have some time to enjoy and experience a new country, and chronicle the (mis)adventures there!</p>
<p>For now, here's some music. This song has followed me around for the last 12 years, and when it is time for me to go away, I hear this song playing somwhere. It's corny, but its nice.<br />
