<p>I've been using my MBP as the main computer at work for a couple of weeks now. It is not officially "supported", and I'm left to my own devices to figure out any issues that arise.</p>
<p>Configuring proxies on the mac for all GUI applications is quite simple. However, most of the *nix tools have trouble with it. Macports, which I love to hate, should read it from the environment's $http_proxy and $rsync_proxy, but for some reason doesn't really do so. The simplest fix, is to override system env variables, and use the macport configuration file to provide the proxy. It works like a charm (one of reason to like macports, I suppose)</p>
<p>Edit $HOME/macports/etc/macports/macports.conf, and add the following.<br />
(I prefer installing macports in its own directory .. if it ever gets too big, I can delete the directory, and go back to using standard tools that come with the mac)</p>
