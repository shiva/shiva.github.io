<p>What a lousy week it has been... I've had this fever all week long, and is still poking its head around me now and then..</p>
<p>I have been down for the last few days with a viral fever. I also made the mistake of calling my family and telling them that I am unwell. They got very worried and came to Chennai in a taxi to pick me up (my mom). (That was embarrasing ... but did feel well pampered).</p>
<p>I will be getting my new <a href="http://www.creative.com/products/product.asp?category=213&subcategory=214&product=10795">Creative Zen micro</a> (mp3 player) next week. Guru tell's me it sounds awesome. I hope he has got the <a href="http://www.sennheiser.com/sennheiser/icm_eng.nsf/root/products_headphones_streetwear_hdseries_05176">Sennheiser HD 202 headphones</a> I had him asked to buy. I'm gonna have a ball of a time next week, when I can finally lay hands on some kewl gadgets that I've been wanting to buy!</p>
