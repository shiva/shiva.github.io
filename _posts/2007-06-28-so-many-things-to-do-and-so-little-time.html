<p>It has just dawned on me that I have more work to do, that when I was employed. So many things to catch up on: emails, <a href="http://orkut.com">orkut</a> messages, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile?viewProfile=&amp;key=7072994">linked-in</a> invites (ohh. <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile?viewProfile=&amp;key=5109233">Kristopher Tate</a>&nbsp;is a contact now! Thanks Kris! :) ). </p>
<p>Talking of linked-in, the pressure from the <a href="http://mashable.com/2006/08/15/facebook-developers-launches-facebook-opening-up/">'opening-up'</a> of <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">facebook</a> is showing. Linked-in has added several new features and made interaction much easier than it was before. Things are where they should be; A free member can get in touch with someone they know directly. No need for any introductions if you know a person. (you don't need to know their mail id, either). Finally someone at Linked-in realized that they need to accelerate the rate at with the interconnections were formed between people. That's where the money is.</p>
<p>I kinda like the Linked-in system. It is one of the most unobtrusive social-networking sites. It doesn't send me a mail for every single action someone does (by default) and also let's me turn stuff off! I like that in a site.</p>
