<p>Here's the the top 3 requested features from iPhone users at large.</p>

<p>And here's what they thought people wanted.</p>

<p>Some Product Manager at Apple needs to think how much this is hurting Apple's brand. Do they want to be branded, yet again, as a company that completely ignores their customers?! At least give some indication as to why you can't get the top three features in. Sure they have a lot of less demanding, faithful sheep in their flock, but now they are going mainstream, and they need to get their act together. Come on Apple! Stop making me feel bad about choosing a product by a company that doesn't give shit about what I want.</p>
<p>I hope they don't go the way of the american auto companies.</p>
