<p>Working with git is fun. However, it is easy to get tired of the log list of parameters one has to use to very often. Git aliases are a great way to deal with this.</p>

<p>For instance, the standard git log, it pretty much useless in any large project, where there are several hundred commits in a day. Most often, the commit you are looking for in probably several pages deep.</p>
<p>The following is from the latest <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux" title="linux by Linus">linux.git</a><br />

<p>Fortunately, git log has options one can use, that make the output look like this:<br />

<p>Another useful command is git show, with the --name-only option. It displays the list of files in a particular commit.<br />
