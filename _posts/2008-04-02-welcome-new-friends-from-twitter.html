<p>I have the very distinct feeling that a bunch of people from India, are going to visit my site today. Maybe, it is too late, but nonetheless, I was compelled to post before I left for work, after staying up the whole night (watching movies). No really - <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0338526/">Van Helsing</a> followed by <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0765429/">American Gangster</a> - two very find movies, I might add, but I digress.</p>
<p>I got the honour, of being one of the few listed on a fellow <a href="http://blog.yuvisense.net/">tech-enthusiast</a>'s list of <a href="http://blog.yuvisense.net/indians-on-twitter/">"twittering" Indians.</a> It's not everyday that I make someone's list, and hence the compulsion to blog about it. So, thank you Yuvi. Since he described me as a programmer, on his list, it's only fair --</p>
