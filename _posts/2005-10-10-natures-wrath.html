<p>What are we humans against the over-powering wrath of mother nature? Time and again, she warns, and tests the best of us, and ceases to amaze us with the brute diplay of power. With all the technology in the world, man still has to grapple with reality of the powerlessness of the human being against forces of nature.</p>
<p>The recent display, in Pakistan and its surrounding, is simply astounding. One cannot, but feel empathy towards the innocent thousand (maybe millions) that have been trampled upon by the brute force of a 7.2 Earthquake.</p>
<p>Check some really thought provoking and heart kindling articles on the net<br />

<p>My heart goes out to all the innocent souls that have lost their homes, their livelyhood and dear ones to one of the worst quakes in the last decade.</p>
