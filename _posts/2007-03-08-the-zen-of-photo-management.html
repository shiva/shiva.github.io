<p>I have been <a href="http://shvelmur.com/wpress/sharpalbum/">rambling</a> for the last month or so, about the need for better photo management. Having acquired a N730 recently, I have started shooting more and more pictures, and the chore of organising them, and sharing them has been such a bore, that I haven't uploaded a single picture.</p>
<p>Well, to change that I launched into building one myself to suit my own needs, only to discover that someone has already thought of most of it and has built a product and a service around it.</p>
<p>Introducing SharpCast.... the ultimate photo management solution. Unlimted space, web 2.0 website, client for syncing multiple image sources like, your mobile phone, Laptop, PCs.. and the list goes on.</p>
<p>Go ahead, <a href="http://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sharpcast.com%2F&amp;ei=EOPvRaO7HZj-gwPbttjnCQ&amp;usg=__x6u1oce_6zGi1Z-LrD1pjc5MAq4=&amp;sig2=HZt2zw6nPowOgv1c2XjJFQ" target="_blank">try it</a>. Check out my photos <a href="http://www.sharpcast.com/photos/user/shvelmur/albums?album=11428_49082886258813" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>I'm going to try and see if we can leverage the photo management infrastructure that is provided by SharpCast and build something out of that.</p>
<p>I'm thinking,</p>
<ol>
<li>Plugin for wordpress</li>
<li>AJAX based slideshow</li>
<li>Photo blog sync</li>
</ol>
<p>I have posted a request on their forums, and will keep you updated on that. </p>
