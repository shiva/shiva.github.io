<p>This post is a little late, but that has never stopped me from doing it anyway. </p>
<p>There are some things that we need to regret ...<br />
<img src="/images/6a00d8341c59aa53ef011570bfc961970b.jpg" alt="Tiananmen tank man" title="Tiananmen tank man" width="620" height="412" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-528" /></p>
<p>And then there are some others, we continue to ignore ...<br />
<img src="/images/tiananmen_tank_man_google_china.gif" alt="tiananmen_tank_man_google_china" title="tiananmen_tank_man_google_china" width="637" height="493" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-529" /></p>
<p>Hope we don't add more such pictures to that list in another 20 years.</p>
