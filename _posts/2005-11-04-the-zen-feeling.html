<p>Atlast!!! Finally!! I got to lay my hands on the Creative Zen Micro I have been drooling over all these days! One of Guru's friend's finally agreed to get it here.</p>
<p>It is much smaller that I thought it would be, but it is one of the coolest gadgets I have laid my hands on. None of the images on the web do any justice to the drool value of this pod-killer. The only disappointment until now, has been the need to shell out $40 for the charger, which I haven't bought as of now. Need to find out how much they would fleece me for it in India.</p>
<p>Along with the zen, came the really kewl Sennheiser. All I can say is that, it is german audio engineering at its very best. The audio fidelity of these headphones are simply amazing.</p>
<p>Check out these links for more information on the above mentioned kewl gadgets:<br />
