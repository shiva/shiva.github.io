<p>To the people of Japan, and the world, Lord Tennyson has these words</p>
<blockquote><p>Tho' much is taken, much abides; and tho'</p>
<p>We are not now that strength which in old days</p>
<p>Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are,--</p>
<p>One equal temper of heroic hearts,</p>
<p>Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will</p>
<p>To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.</p></blockquote>
