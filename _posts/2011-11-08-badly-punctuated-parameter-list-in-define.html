<p>Sometimes working with an old c compiler brings up painful, yet fun-filled days of making it speak the same language as you, and sometimes you just go "*$&amp;%*$#&amp;% you piece of sh** compiler"</p>
<p>I hadÂ one such moment today, and after I had returned to Zen (some soul-searching and some google searching), I realized it quite simple.</p>
<p><code><br />
$ gmake<br />
...<br />
...<br />
some_file.h:42: badly punctuated parameter list in `#define'<br />
some_file.h:64: badly punctuated parameter list in `#define'<br />
Failed to compile<br />
$<br />
</code></p>
<p>This was caused by the following:</p>
<p><code><br />
file: some_file.h<br />
-----------------<br />
...<br />
...<br />
#define LOG(...) { printf (##__VA_ARGS__);<br />
}<br />
...<br />
...<br />
</code></p>
<p>This works in most modern C compilers. However, if you happen to use one from the 80s (I exaggerate a little - not by much), it throws the error as above. You can fix this as follows:</p>
<p><code><br />
file: some_file.h<br />
-----------------<br />
...<br />
...<br />
#define LOG(ARGS...) { printf (##ARGS);<br />
}<br />
...<br />
...<br />
</code></p>
