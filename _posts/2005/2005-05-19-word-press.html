<p>Wordpress is a nice small CMS written entirely using php and mysql!<br />It makes using blogger, MT and other such services entirely useless!! If you have a website and would like to manage your website effectively go for <a href="http://wordpress.org/" target="_blank">this</a>!!</p>
<p>I'm planning to switch to it in the near future! I'm working on choosing a nice skin and customising it for my site!<br />Do check back soon!</p>
<p>*Update 13-Nov-2009* You shouldn't be here if you are looking for me. Well, considering that you are reading this, I've messed up somehow. You can find my latest ramblings at <a href="http://blog.shiv.me">http://blog.shiv.me</a>, or if you are the micro-blogging kind, head over to <a href="http://twitter.com/shiva">http://twitter.com/shiva</a> or <a href="http://facebook.com/shivanand">http://facebook.com/shivanand</a>.</p>
<p>You are so inclined, you can drop me an email at shvelmur [at] gmail</p>
<p>Ohhh.. I forget, when I last wrote this wordpress was a nice small CMS, today, I would suggest you move to <a href="http://github.com/yuvipanda/HiSlain">HiSlain</a>. Written and maintained by a cool kid from India, <a href="http://yuvi.in">Yuvi</a>
