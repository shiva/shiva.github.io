<p>Yup, been a very long time since I blogged!! but I am back again!<br /><b>Thanks to my fellow util-seeker Sudhin for this bit of news<br /></b></p>
<p>Adobe Systems Incorporated (Nasdaq: ADBE) has announced a definitive agreement to acquire Macromedia (Nasdaq: MACR) in an all-stock transaction valued at approximately $3.4 billion. Under the terms of the agreement, which has been approved by both boards of directors, Macromedia stockholders will receive, at a fixed exchange ratio, 0.69 shares of Adobe common stock for every share of Macromedia common stock in a tax-free exchange. Based on Adob &rsquo;s and Macromedia&rsquo;s closing prices on Friday April 15, 2005, this represents a price of $41.86 per share of Macromedia common stock.</p>
<p>The combination of Adobe and Macromedia strengthens our mission of helping people and organizations communicate better. Through the combination of our powerful development, authoring and collaboration tools &#8211; and the complementary functionality of PDF and Flash &#8211; we have the opportunity to drive an industry-defining technology platform that delivers compelling, rich content and applications across a wide range of devices and operating systems.</p>
<p>By combining the passion and creativity of two leading-edge companies, we will continue driving innovations that are changing the ways people everywhere are experiencing and interacting with information.</p>
