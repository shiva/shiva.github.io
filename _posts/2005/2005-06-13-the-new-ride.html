<p>I'm planning to get a new car in the offing.</p>
<p>The brand new Maruti Swift ! yup! It is quite a kewl car, modelled quite a bit on the new "Beetle"<br />

<p>I'm planning to get the VXi variant without ABS. It has got a kewl 87Bhp@6500 and 113 Nm@4500! Detailed specs <a href="http://www.marutiswift.com/html/Specifications.asp" target="_blank">here</a><br />
