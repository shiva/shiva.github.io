<p>Started working in VC.NET. The Visual Studio 2005 BETA is out! really kewl stuff. I simply love the IDE enhancements<br />
I had to port an application from VC6 to VC.NET. It was such a breeze. a little googling and most of the issues are under control<br />
Will post an article on it sometime</p>
<p>I also got myself, the GoF Design Patterns book! simply amazing and such a great read, I must say</p>
