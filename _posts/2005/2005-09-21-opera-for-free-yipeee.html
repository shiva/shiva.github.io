<p>There was once a wondeful browser called "Opera". The lucid interface, the smal memory footprint - it was simply browsing heaven.</p>
<p>Then came the version loaded with ads, heavy, sluggish UI and a hug memory footprint in the name of new improved UI. The ads loaded version of opera turned out to nag-ware and I totally detested it and moved to other browsers (read Firefox). Get online and check websites out became "swimming" and not "surfing"</p>
<p>Finally, the good old days are back! get the latest version of Opera sans ads for free.</p>

<p>Enjoy! Welcome back to the internet -let's go surfing</p>
