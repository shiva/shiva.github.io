<p>As technology enters our lives, dare I say, invade our lives, the concept of radical design has been ubiquitous. It's design, design and more design, for last few days for me. I came across quite a few very kewl interfaces and design concepts (a detailed listing below). Some much of what we do, is so dependant on how efficiently a product has been designed. How minimal and useful the interface is.</p>
<p>some kewl sites and resources<br />

<p>Check these websites out. Some insanely kewl and creative stuff.</p>
