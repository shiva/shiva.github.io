<div class="goalentry">
<p>I wanted to get the pod nano initially, but I chose to get the Creative Zen Micro instead for reasons listed below:</p>
<p>Why the Nano is a piece of junk<br />1. Cracked screens &#8211; heard quite a few reports of that and since I live in India and the Nano cost about 2 as much as it is in the US, I didn&#8217;t want to risk it</p>
<p>2. Flimsy &#8211; the entire player bends with little pressure applied, a little more I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;d end up with two pieces! (Definitely not suited for 40deg C and extremely dusty conditions that I have to go through everyday to work and back)</p>
<p>3. Battery replacement costs half as much as the player</p>
<p>4. about 25% more cost than the zen micro which has about 20% more space</p>
