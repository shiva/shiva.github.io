<p>OBL - Out about learning, the second time to the same place, same people, but totally a new experience. On a deeper note, I rediscovered myself! Quite a few things about myself, that I hadn't noticed before came to light.</p>
<p>I had a great time too, meeting a few new people, and a few new versions of old ones!<br />
The day we were returning to Chennai, we went to  a kewl pub called "Alibi" in Church Street, where we managed to get two free pitchers of beer (try the Castle beer there ... really neat!)</p>
<p>I am in the process of selecting and uploading some photos. Comeback later for the url</p>
