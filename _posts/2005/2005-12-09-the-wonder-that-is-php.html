<p>PHP is an incredibly easy to use scripting language and yesterday I had my first meeting with it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know I support and fix some issues in wordpress, but that just requires programming knowledge, and not exactly great php exposure. But yesterday, I wrote a small tool to track some timesheet info, in php and the whole thing took about 1.5 hours to complete. Slick UI, storing and retreiving from DB et al!</p>
<p>Simply amazed by the depth and breadth of support for other resources like databases, network protocols etc by the default implementation of php! Truly a programmer's paradise has to have a webserver running with php support!</p>
