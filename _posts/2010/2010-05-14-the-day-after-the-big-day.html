<p>I turned 30 yesterday.</p>
<p>A whole day has passed since I left my 20s. They say it is a big day. They say it is a dreaded day. It was neither. Just busy (which is good).</p>
<p>I chanced upon [Douglas Adams' post][1] from 1999:</p>
<p>> 1.	everything that’s already in the world when you’re born is just normal;<br />
> 2.	anything that gets invented between then and before you turn thirty is incredibly exciting and creative and with any luck you can make a career out of it;<br />
> 3.	anything that gets invented after you’re thirty is against the natural order of things and the beginning of the end of civilisation as we know it until it’s been around for about ten years when it gradually turns out to be alright really.<br />
> Apply this list to movies, rock music, word processors and mobile phones to work out how old you are.</p>
<p>For me, Point 3 is intensely scary. I have lived all my life being on the bleeding edge (as much as I could afford, atleast). I've always been in constant search of tools and technology that will make every living moment better than the one before. It has been an affliction, but one that I have throughly enjoyed, and internalised even!</p>
<p>I hope that I continue to do that for the next decade (and prove Douglas Adams' wrong). A few posts ago, I took a partly political stand against the [ipad][3], and decided to not vote for it with my wallet. I have also been [vocal][2], about my distaste with Apple's lock-down of the app deployment on the iphone and ipad. In the last few weeks, I'm starting to question myself. Maybe it is an effect of #3, as DNA pointed out. But then, this is could just be my way out, a way to weasel from [the stand][2] I took ;)</p>
