<p>Did anyone else notice that buzz has an RSS feed for everything!!</p>
<p>Here's a <a href="http://www.google.com/buzz/thomashawk22/Swv6u36BGC2/Buzz-should-let-you-post-inline-images-like-you  ">conversation</a> that @<a href="http://www.google.com/profiles/thomashawk22#buzz">Thomashawk</a> started</p>
<p>Here's the <a href="feed://buzz.googleapis.com/feeds/104987932455782713675/comments/z12xt1zqbyjjcx44v04cdpjgjy34xxvg45k  ">feed for that entry</a></p>
<p>Here's the feed for <a href="feed://buzz.googleapis.com/feeds/104987932455782713675/public/posted  ">the owner's entries</a></p>
<p>Theoretically, one could build a service that aggregates only specific conversations (and keep them updated), or only a small group etc... No more reading data from a firehose!!</p>
<p>That is very nice.</p>
<p>P.S: also this could be a way to aggregate all your webservices into one super feed, that can then be posted elsewhere (comments and all!!)</p>
<p>The power is endless, so be cautious when exercising it</p>
