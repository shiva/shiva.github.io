<p>Thanks for the iPhone, Mr. Jobs. There is a new way to protest the iPhone. I don't have to <a href="http://blog.shiv.me/2010/02/04/ipad-is-ibad-petition/">sign petitions</a> anymore. I can now take my $500 <a href="http://bit.ly/cXseFC">elsewhere</a>, for a slightly more open experience. I <a href="http://blog.shiv.me/2010/02/03/i-too-have-something-to-say-about-the-ipad/">didn't ask for much</a>, but I don't have to wait on your whim any longer (no offense meant to you personally, Mr Jobs).</p>
