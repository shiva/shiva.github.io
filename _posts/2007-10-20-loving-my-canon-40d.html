<p>I recently got myself a Canon 40D. After a 3 year wait, I can finally afford to buy myself a DSLR, and have been going crazy with it for the last couple of weeks.</p>

<p>Largely influenced by <a href="http://thomashawk.com/">Thomas Hawk's</a> <a href="http://thomashawk.com/2007/09/principles-and-guidelines-for-modern.html">passion</a>, I have started carrying the camera everywhere I go: to work, when I go shopping, and even when I am just walking around the neighbourhood. I shot this picture, on my back from work, last Friday. With all the shooting, I am running out of HDD space very quickly. I am ok, for the next month (I have 2 external 80GB HDD + around 60GB in my laptop). After that, I will need to move the old ones to DVDs (something, which I hate doing: easy to lose shots, and difficult to retrieve).</p>
<p>Any suggestions are welcome (If anyone is reading this!). Oh.. I almost forgot,</p>
