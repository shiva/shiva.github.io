<p>Have I mentioned the long-standing obsession with stationery, especially, fountain pens? Well, it is a bit of problem, really. In the last few months, I have started hoarding them. It started with one-- a Lamy. Once I discovered how one can procure junk on eBay for very little money, I quickly ended up with a selection. As these things go, I suddenly had the increased "need" for inks that are not blue, or black. Nay, simple colours won't do for the truly obsessed.</p>
<p>Here is the result of the latest rotation of inks and pens.</p>
